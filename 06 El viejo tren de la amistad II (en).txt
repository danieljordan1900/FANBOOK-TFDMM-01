In one of the train cars headed to Canterlot, a young pony trembled amidst the oppressive darkness. The only illumination came from the faint light filtering through some glass panels in the ceiling. With his head bowed among crates and cargo equipment, the pony had hardly slept the night before and had gone over 12 hours without a morsel of food. Despite his physical exhaustion, his spirit remained strong, keeping him focused and awake. However, the anxiety that enveloped him couldn't be ignored. He was aware that the moment was approaching.

Amidst this anticipation, he decided to open the bottle of cider he had been given as a prize. It was the first time in his life he had tasted cider, and the drink's flavor only managed to burn his throat and worsen his discomfort. Nonetheless, he continued drinking, consuming approximately a third of the bottle before setting it aside. Soon, the effects of the drink quelled his trembling, and his mind cleared even more. He felt ready, but there was still some time left, so he decided to turn on the music player he had with him and put on his headphones.

Those headphones were so new that they still had their box on the side, another gift he hadn't wanted but also couldn't refuse. It was probably the only opportunity in his life to use headphones.

Intrigued by this modern device, the young pony checked the box and read to himself: "Silent Gamma Headphones - Model C."

//----------------------//

"...and that's what happened," Dash said confidently.

"Wow! That was amazing. You fought against a giant crocodile, saved Daring Do from being devoured by a swarm of ant-locusts, and restored peace in a kingdom of hippos. You're awesome, Dashie!" Pinkie Pie exclaimed excitedly, bouncing in her seat.

"Yes, it's truly an 'amazing' story, Rainbow," Applejack commented skeptically.

"And after all that, Daring Do gave you the original draft of her latest book. Wow..." Fluttershy said thoughtfully, looking at her own saddlebag.

"Yeah, that's right," Dash confirmed.

The four ponies looked at the pile of disheveled and battered documents that Dash had left on one of the seats.

"It's really a valuable document, dear. But I suppose, by bringing it here, this is the surprise you have prepared for Twilight, right?" Rarity asked.

"Of course! Knowing her, she may have already read the book ten times. But I'm absolutely sure she'll be surprised when I give her this," Dash replied, full of excitement.

Rainbow Dash had already imagined several times how things would unfold next. Her friends would bombard her with questions and praise for her brilliant idea, for which she had even prepared some preemptive answers. However, none of that happened. Instead, her friends exchanged concerned glances.

"What's going on?" Dash asked, worried about her friends' lack of enthusiasm. "Don't you think she'll be surprised?"

"Of course, she'll be surprised," Applejack replied. "It's just that your story doesn't explain anything about what happened earlier."

"Explain what?" Dash replied, feigning innocence.

"Who was that suspicious pony we saw earlier?" Applejack asked seriously.

"Oh, that, it's not important. She's just a fan who wants me to sign a contract to become her star model. Can you believe it?" Dash responded.

The other ponies looked puzzled, Applejack frowned, and Rarity raised an eyebrow.

"A fan...?" Applejack replied, inquisitive.

"Well, you should talk to her. She shouldn't be lurking around you like that. It'll only cause you trouble and stress you out even more," Pinkie said while eating some muffins she had produced from somewhere. The other ponies gave her a brief reproachful look, as it was a somewhat cheeky piece of advice considering that their pink friend had acted that way numerous times in the past.

"Stressed out? What are you talking about, Pinkie? I'm perfectly fine."

"Pinkie's right, darling. You look terrible. Have you seen yourself in a mirror?" Rarity said.

Dash furrowed her brow. She didn't usually trust Rarity's opinion when it came to her appearance, as she tended to exaggerate. But the doubt had already been planted, so she decided to consult the pony she knew would never lie to her.

"Fluttershy, do I really look that bad?" Rainbow asked, pushing Applejack aside with her gaze.

"Well... yes, you don't look that bad, but when you arrived, I was really worried. Well, we all were," Fluttershy replied as she handed Dash a mirror.

Dash soon saw her reflection in the mirror. Fluttershy was right. Her mane was more disheveled than usual, and her irritated eyes showed slight bags. Although she still looked awesome, she wasn't in her best shape.

"Well, I think you should talk to your 'fan.' We have a special day with Twilight today, and it would be wrong to bring her this kind of trouble," Applejack scolded.

"You're worrying too much, Applejack. Everything's fine!" Dash replied sharply.

At that moment, the train car's doorbell rang. Shortly after, a train employee stuck his head through the door, allowing the noise from what seemed to be a large group of foals on the other side to grow louder.

"Oh, excuse me, is Miss Rainbow Dash here? Several young ones wish to meet her," the employee asked. On the other side of the door, the chorus of compliments and excited screams grew louder.

Applejack and the rest of Dash's friends turned to where Rainbow Dash had been sitting, but the pegasus wasn't there. Instead, she peeked her head out of a train window.

"Heh, heh... it's really hot today," Dash said to her friends, concealing her nervousness as she re-entered the train car completely.

//----------------------//

The train car in which the pony friends were located erupted into a deafening noise of excitement and cheers.

"IT'S RAINBOW DASH!" "SHE'S AMAZING!" "YES!" The foals who had entered cheered with joy. Their friends watched them with smiles, except for Applejack, who maintained a skeptical look.

"All right, I've got this," Dash said, more animated, leaving her friends behind. "Wow, I guess everyone came for an autograph, right?"

"YESSS!" the young foals cheered. Some were jumping, and others stomped the floor.

"Okay, okay, settle down. Form a line and give me something to sign." Dash flew to a seat and pulled out a pen from somewhere in her mane. "All right, who's first?"

Without needing further instructions, the colts and fillies quickly formed a line. The first in line was a filly with a pink hat and ribbon, carrying a book that seemed to be a cookbook. With great joy, she handed it to Dash.

"Heh, are you sure you want me to sign here? Sure thing." Quickly, Dash passed her hoof over the open book.

"Yes! Definitely! Your Blackberry Pie recipe is just like my grandma's," the filly said before moving away from the line.

"Huh?" Dash said in confusion. Behind her, Pinkie Pie could be heard choking on one of the muffins she was eating. "Okay... next!"

"Me! Me! Here, here!" It was a colt with blue fur and white sneakers. He handed Dash a brochure for travel and exploration sneakers.

"This is better! Here you go." Quickly, Dash passed her hoof over the brochure.

"Awesome! Now my parents will have to buy me the same sneakers you wear, yay!" the colt said before running out of the train car.

Behind Dash, murmurs from her friends could be heard. Dash didn't turn around; her face already reflected a feeling that something wasn't right.

"Okay, you!" Dash stopped the next young filly who had stickers on her face. "Where do you want me to sign?"

"On my fashion magazine," the filly replied cheerfully.

"And that's because...?" the concerned pegasus questioned.

"Because I love your makeup! Your glitters and stickers are divine! Yiiip!" the excited filly squealed.

Rainbow Dash had a look of fear on her face.

"Okay, here's your autograph," said the pegasus, hastily dismissing the filly. "THANKS FOR COMING, BUT THAT'S ALL FOR NOW!"

Words of confusion and disappointment were heard among the foals.

But before anyone could complain, Dash continued, "I'LL CONTINUE WITH THE AUTOGRAPHS WHEN THE TRAIN REACHES THE NEXT STATION! I PROMISE!"

Maybe they were very polite or trusted their idol Rainbow Dash's promise, but the vast majority decided to obey despite being dissatisfied. Thus, with the help of the train employee, Rainbow Dash quickly ushered all the young ponies out of the car.

Dash sighed tiredly when she closed the train car door after the last foal had crossed it. She had solved one problem, but now she had a bigger one behind her.

"Wow, Rainbow, I didn't know you liked wearing sneakers," Pinkie Pie said as she inspected a brochure that one of the colts had dropped.

Before a second passed after Pinkie finished speaking, Dash, at a considerable speed, took Pinkie's brochure and all the others on the floor. She then threw them out of one of the train windows.

"Phew, there we go. Those kids should take better care of where they leave their trash. Cleanliness is very important, don't you think?" Dash said, panting, as she closed the window.

Her friends looked puzzled for a moment, then exchanged some accepting words among themselves, intending to let the matter slide. However, Applejack was not willing to let it pass.

"That's enough! Rainbow Dash, what are you hiding?" said the farm pony in a stern tone as she approached the pegasus.

"Hiding something? What could I be hiding?" Dash said with a slightly tense laugh.

"Since you arrived, I've felt that something's NOT RIGHT, and when something's NOT RIGHT, I can't stay silent. I'll ask you again, WHAT ARE YOU HIDING, RAINBOW DASH?"

"Hey, calm down, Applejack. Everything's fine. I'm not hiding anything, right, girls?" Dash said, seeking support from her other friends. The rest of her friends did not respond.

Silence filled the car with tension.

Perceiving which side her friends were on, Dash felt that she had had enough of this situation and, in an annoyed tone, told them, "I just remembered that I need to buy something. I'll go ahead. See you in Canterlot."

"You...!" Applejack said, now really upset, but she was interrupted by someone else.

"Do you plan to leave already, Rainbow Dash? I thought you'd want to spend more time with your friends," a voice from the other side of the car asked.

They all turned their gaze to the back of the car, where Magazine Doublereport herself was comfortably seated, sipping on a soda.

//----------------------//

The train continued to advance slowly through the meadow, with tranquil flocks of sheep casually crossing the path towards Canterlot.

Meanwhile, in the special guests' car, a more active and bustling situation was beginning to develop. The mysterious red-maned pegasus with black stripes, who had suddenly appeared in the car, stood up and approached the group of friends with a mischievous look. She had a radiant and confident smile, befitting a successful businesspony. And that's exactly what she was, as evidenced by the yellow tie she was wearing. Magazine Doublereport needed no introduction; her image said it all. However, she couldn't help but engage in formalities, especially when she enjoyed performances so much.

At that moment, nothing amused her more than the fear she sensed in Rainbow Dash.

"Hello! Nice to meet you! I'm Magazine Doublereport, owner and CEO of the Averages consortium. You can call me MAGI. It's a pleasure to meet the heroic and acclaimed friends of Princess Twilight Sparkle," Magi exclaimed, her exclamation almost sounding like a whinny.

One by one, she began to greet the surprised Rarity, Pinkie Pie, and Fluttershy while handing them promotional brochures.

"Hey, you're not the pony from earlier..." Applejack said.

"And you must be Applejack, nice to meet you!" Magi said, shaking Applejack's right hoof so vigorously in a greeting that the farm pony fell over, feeling dizzy.

In this way, Magi finished greeting everyone.

"Excuse me for interrupting your pleasant gathering, but I need to talk to your friend Rainbow Dash for a moment," Magi said, approaching the rainbow pegasus with excessive confidence. "Actually, all your friends look as great as you mentioned. By the way, I need you to sign some additional documents to include the Crystal Empire in the target market of the marketing campaign. Dash... Dash? Are you there?"

Dash didn't answer. Her terrified eyes only slowly reflected the scene unfolding before her.

Pinkie Pie was holding back laughter in her seat while looking at a pajama brochure where Dash was wearing rabbit ears. Rarity, astounded, was standing and looking at a fashion brochure where Dash wore an elegant spring dress. Fluttershy, on the other hand, seemed not to react at all, or rather, she was paralyzed by the content of the friendly hunting and stuffed animal brochure she still held between her hooves.

Without waiting to hear a word from her friends, Dash shot out like a rainbow lightning bolt through one of the windows.

Her friends were surprised by the sudden departure of their loyal friend.

"Great! There she goes again... Is she always like this?" Pinkie asked, confused. She wasn't the only one; they all, including Applejack, looked at each other in bewilderment.

"I think I've heard of Averages Consortium before," Rarity said, seemingly trying to remember something. "Miss Magi, you just mentioned that you're our friend's legal representative. Could you please provide more details?"

"Of course, Miss Rarity, you see, your friend Rainbow Dash recently signed a 'binding contract' with the Averages Consortium, allowing us to use her image and name, given her importance as our star client. I personally assume responsibility for managing all the legal aspects involving her. It's a great effort considering how hectic her 'daily schedule' is. However, it's a necessary investment to make her the new and biggest celebrity in all of Equestria," Magi concluded with a big smile.

Rarity was left flabbergasted after hearing that statement, just like the others.

Applejack, on the other hand, barely showed emotion. She already expected something bad from that executive-looking pony. The farm pony knew that a 'binding contract' was something bad no matter how you bit it. She wasn't a legal expert like Twilight, but her grandmother had told her enough stories about that infamous document to know what kind of trouble it could cause.

"So that's what she did," said Applejack, connecting the dots in her mind. "So, that's why you've been tailing our friend, isn't it, Miss Magi?"

Magi, sensing Applejack's hostility and what she might be thinking, responded quickly.

"I would like there to be no misunderstandings between us, but Miss Rainbow Dash received a fair deal and was fully informed about the scope of the document she signed with my organization. Consequently, I ensure she complies with what was agreed upon," Magi said with a smile but a serious tone.

"Agreed upon? And what's that?" inquired Applejack, seeking a more detailed explanation from Magi.

"Well, if you allow me a little of your time, I can briefly detail it..." Magi replied. Inside, the executive pegasus sighed tiredly. She didn't particularly enjoy this explanatory talk, but she had to do it if she wanted to achieve her goals.

With nothing else to add, Magi proceeded to explain to the pony friends how, after meeting Dash and her signing a 'binding contract' several days ago at the Averages Consortium's main offices in Manehattan, she and her partners began using Dash's image in commercial advertisements. Magi clarified the detail that Dash wasn't the pony appearing in the brochures but rather models wearing her same colors. It had been a complicated and tedious makeup process, but in the end, it had the personal approval of Rainbow Dash. However, Magi didn't mention that the latter had been achieved through lies and deception.

That was how Magazine Doublereport worked, sometimes using manipulation and deceit as means to achieve her goals. Her smile, on the other hand, wasn't fake; she enjoyed the dark satisfaction of having control over others.

Upon concluding her explanation, a question hung in the air among the group of friends.

"But why would Rainbow Dash want to become a commercial celebrity? She doesn't seek that kind of fame," Fluttershy asked innocently.

"It's true that at first, your friend Rainbow Dash showed no interest in my initial proposal," Magi replied calmly as she took a sip of her soda. "However, she changed her mind when I included in my offer the opportunity to acquire the original drafts of Daring Do's latest book. She was excited to get them. I think she mentioned something about 'winning a very special competition.' But I could be mistaken."

The four friends looked at each other and then at the stack of documents on one of the seats. Everything was starting to make sense. Three years ago, the five friends had made a promise to celebrate or surprise their great friend Twilight on a day like this, without specifying the type of celebration (it could be a party, a gift, or some other gesture), but making it very clear that they would do so by supporting each other, without any competitive spirit among them. However, recent events indicated that their pegasus friend had decided to set aside that rule.

"All of this is really shocking, Miss Magi. We'd like to know more about this delicate matter, if you don't mind spending more time with us..." Rarity declared, starting to understand the mess Rainbow Dash had gotten herself into.

"I don't mind at all, Miss Rarity," Magi interrupted. "However, I don't have much time to offer further explanations. I have a meeting with the consortium's executives today, and Rainbow Dash must be present. I'm obliged to take her to the Manehattan offices, or else your friend could face serious legal troubles. I don't want that to happen. If you'll permit me..."

"Don't worry about that, I'll go get her," Applejack announced abruptly.

"Do you know where she is?" Rarity asked, surprised in unison with Pinkie Pie. Applejack nodded in response. Seeing her so sure, she and the rest of her friends didn't ask more questions. Magi also noticed this detail.

"Can you really bring her back?" Magi asked, inquisitive.

"That's right," confirmed Applejack, who seemed uninterested in negotiating.

"Very well, I truly appreciate it. Then, I'll stay here until you return. But no more than 15 minutes," said Magi, accepting Applejack's proposal with some skepticism.

"I won't be that long; I'll be back soon," said Applejack, adjusting her hat before quickly exiting through the rear door of the car.

The rest of her friends watched her leave with concern. They all wondered what was happening with their friend Rainbow Dash and sincerely hoped that Applejack would bring her back. As for Magi...

"I have samples of the new Jumy Gingerbread Cookies. Would anyone like some?" Magi offered.

Pinkie Pie waved her right hoof in the air, excited about the offer.

//----------------------//

On the delayed train from Ponyville to Canterlot, Applejack trotted toward the last of the cars. She found it closed, which didn't surprise her since it was a cargo car. However, she was intrigued that it was so tightly secured, even with sealed windows. The farm pony didn't dwell on it and climbed a set of stairs to the roof of the car. Soon, she spotted her rainbow-maned pegasus friend sitting at the opposite end.

Without a word, Applejack walked over to Rainbow and sat down beside her. Rainbow didn't move. Her mane had lost its luster, and even her wings seemed droopy at her sides. Her gaze was fixed on some distant point on the train tracks.

"Well... you came," Rainbow said.

"Yeah."

"How did you know I'd be here?"

"You like to see things in motion."

"Yeah, that's true," Dash said, turning her gaze back to the train tracks.

"Magi already told us part of what happened. But I'd like to hear the rest from you."

"That's good," Dash said without looking at her.

Applejack waited for her to continue, but nothing happened. "So, are you going to tell me what happened?"

"It's not your problem."

"Rainbow..."

"No, really, it's not your problem, or anyone else's. It's just that I... did something really stupid."

"And that's why you don't want to talk about it. You think you can handle it on your own."

"Exactly."

Applejack sighed and, with a swift hoof movement, smacked Rainbow on the head. "Ouch! HEY!" The irritated pegasus turned to look at her friend. The farm pony was now facing her with a stern look typical of the Apple family.

"Tell me, Rainbow, when did my BRAVE BEST FRIEND turn into a CHICKEN COWARD?"

Rainbow Dash's eyes flashed with anger, and part of her mane seemed to regain its shine. Applejack was secretly pleased to see that reaction but kept her emotions hidden. If she wanted to successfully bring Rainbow back to her friends, she had to be more careful than Puss in Boots.

"I'M NOT A CHICKEN, AND THIS ISN'T YOUR BUSINESS!" Rainbow Dash exclaimed.

"REALLY, IS IT SO IMPORTANT THAT YOU'RE PUTTING OUR FRIENDSHIP ASIDE?" Applejack retorted, but Dash didn't respond. Getting no response, Applejack turned around and began to walk away.

Rainbow Dash hesitated for a moment, but seeing her friend walking away, she quickly flew to catch up with her.

"HEY, HEY, WAIT! I'm not leaving them behind; I just don't want them involved in this," Dash said, trying to catch up.

"IT'S THE SAME THING," Applejack asserted.

"YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND."

"THEN EXPLAIN... PLEASE," Applejack pleaded.

"It's just... I'm really embarrassed," Dash said, letting herself slump.

Applejack looked at her puzzled. "Is that all?"

"It's much more than 'just that,'" Dash replied, her expression filled with frustration.

"Is it really that bad?"

"Yes," Dash remained silent for a moment, but before Applejack could ask again, she continued. "After signing that stupid contract, they called me back. That's when I found out they had been doing cooking promotions with my image."

Applejack looked at her in confusion. "That doesn't sound so bad, Rainbow. Magi said..."

"They also did beauty promotions."

"Okay, but..."

"They even did special mare's clothing promotions for Hearts and Hooves Day," Dash said, covering her face in embarrassment.

Applejack fell silent for a moment and then continued. "Is there more?"

"Yes... a lot more," Dash replied with an anguished expression.

There was a long pause between them. Only the sound of the train moving forward could be heard. Applejack began to reflect, trying to understand her overwhelmed friend. In the past, similar situations had arisen due to unfounded rumors in a school newspaper, and Rainbow Dash had not taken it well back then. Now, on the other hand, her friend was caught up in a real mess of her own making. Considering her friend's massive ego, she could only imagine an equal amount of shame weighing her down on the inside.

Applejack sighed. "Looks like this time you've really gotten yourself neck-deep in trouble. And how many ponies will Magi's magazines reach?"

"According to what she told me, everypony in Equestria will have a magazine by the end of next week. By then, my public image will be ruined," Dash replied.

"And how did you plan to fix it?"

"Something will come to me... like it always does!" Dash said with a confident smile, but then she looked away. Applejack knew that gesture was a lie.

The train continued to advance slowly through the meadow. Tranquil herds of sheep could be seen grazing on the horizon, and other groups crossed the train's path. An interval of silence passed between the two ponies until Applejack broke the silence.

"And all of this for a book?"

"Yes... It's really silly when I think about it now. I could have thought of something else. Like going on a trip or some kind of competition among us. But NO, I WANTED TO DO 'SOMETHING INCREDIBLE!'" Dash said, extending her front hooves into the air and then slumping down pitifully. "I guess deep down, I wanted to do something better than what you did."

"Rainbow, we promised we wouldn't compete against each other. Not for this," scolded Applejack.

"I KNOW! ... I know," Dash sighed wearily.

"The others need to hear it from you."

"Yes, but... the faces they made. I can't bear it, Applejack. I..."

"I'll be there, they won't laugh," said Applejack, placing her hoof on her friend's shoulder.

Dash looked at Applejack, touched, like a child receiving forgiveness from their mother. However, she then lowered her gaze and returned to her usual self. "Alright, Applejack. I'll tell them everything, but after that, I'll have to go with Magi. She has some meeting, gathering, whatever, and I have to be there. I think it'll be short... I hope."

The farm pony remained silent for a moment and then looked away.

"If that's really what you want, we'll accept it," Applejack said, her face partially obscured by her hat.

"Umph, thanks..." Dash seemed to be suspicious of Applejack's words, but she continued, "Well, let's go."

Rainbow Dash and Applejack agilely descended from the roof of the car and returned to the interior of the train. Upon their return, they found Magi and the rest of their friends. After a brief greeting, Dash began to explain everything that had happened. Although she omitted several details about her visit to the Averages Tower, she was quite clear about how she had been treated and the circumstances under which she had signed the binding contract with Magi. She also narrated what happened afterward, her return to Average's offices, and how she had been evading Magi to prevent further use of her image in promotions. She continued her story until her arrival on the train that day.

//----------------------//

"And that's what really happened," Rainbow Dash finished.

"Oh my goodness! But why did you do all that?" Fluttershy asked.

"I just wanted to give Twilight an amazing day, better than what you all had planned. But when things started going wrong, I panicked and... ended up getting into this mess," Rainbow Dash replied, feeling dejected in front of her friends.

Her friends looked at her in silence. Those mixed looks of concern and pity were too much for Dash, who quickly turned her back on them. "Well, now I have to go fulfill Magi's contract if I don't want to end up in prison or something worse. Tell Twilight I'll see her..."

"Wait right there, Rainbow Dash," Rarity interrupted. "You don't think we'll let you go that easily, do you?"

"Oh, what..." Rainbow Dash didn't finish her response as Applejack's lasso quickly wrapped around her, immobilizing her and leaving her on the ground. Applejack climbed on top of her, making sure she couldn't move.

"WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE...?!" Rainbow Dash's mouth was covered by a box of muffins.

"We're helping a friend fulfill a promise. That's what we're doing," Pinkie said cheerfully, sitting down beside Dash and securing her flank. Fluttershy did the same on the other side, but she looked more embarrassed.

Dash could only watch as Rarity addressed Magi.

"Magi, dear, would you be interested in hearing a proposal to allow Dash to stay with us for the day?" Rarity asked determinedly.

"I'm listening," the executive pegasus replied impassively.

"As you know, I own several dress shops throughout Equestria. As a young entrepreneur, I seek to expand my horizons, and joining your Consortium would be a great opportunity for my business. Of course, I would need to study the benefits your organization offers, but you can consider me very interested in becoming part of your community from today," Rarity concluded. Meanwhile, Rainbow, who was a prisoner, struggled with all her might, her eyes filled with desperation.

"It's a very interesting proposal. Unfortunately, as I mentioned before your friend returned, Rainbow Dash's situation is beyond my direct control. The Consortium board won't accept that your friend refused to attend today's meeting just because..." Magi said seriously but stopped when she saw the downcast faces of the group of ponies in front of her. She was particularly intrigued by the pony called Pinkie, who had a sign that read 'PLEASE' with a sad face drawn on it. She began to hesitate. After observing them for a few seconds, Magi finally sighed in surrender.

"However... I can tell you that I failed to find her," she said immediately. Joy erupted in the train car, and then Magi raised her voice, "Instead, I got to know the other extraordinary friends of the princess, and they were very excited to visit the Averages Consortium headquarters. What do you say? Are you in agreement?"

Rarity turned to her friends, and none of them were opposed, except for Dash, who was still trapped by Applejack. The rainbow-maned pegasus kept shaking her head.

"Yes, we're all in agreement," Rarity said without concern.

"Excellent, I'll be expecting you then," Magi said with a satisfied smile.

Applejack finally released Dash. The rainbow-maned pegasus immediately exclaimed, "WHAT ARE YOU THINKING? DIDN'T YOU HEAR EVERYTHING I SAID ABOUT HER?"

"We understand perfectly, Rainbow Dash. But it's not the first time we've dealt with merchants of that kind. No offense," Rarity quickly addressed Magi.

"Don't worry," replied Magi, who was calmly sipping a beverage while sitting in one of the seats.

"Rainbow, we've taken much worse risks in the past. Have you forgotten?" Applejack questioned.

"But this is different. It's not a monster or some strange threat trying to end Equestria. It's MY STUPID MISTAKE. You're not supposed to have to deal with this too," Dash said angrily but with tears welling up in her eyes.

"Alright, alright, it's okay, Dashie. It's not so bad. We all make mistakes. Besides, it's just a visit to a suspicious company where they could probably brainwash us." Pinkie Pie leaned against Dash. Behind them, Magi raised an eyebrow.

"You can always count on us. And don't forget about Twilight; she might be able to help you with your legal problem," Fluttershy said as she approached Rainbow Dash on the other side.

"That's right, she could help. Wait, Twilight... WE HAVEN'T DECIDED WHO'S HANDLING TODAY'S SURPRISE YET!" Dash exclaimed in concern.

"Don't worry about that, silly. I'll give up my spot," Pinkie said without a hint of regret.

"Me too," Fluttershy added.

"Girls... you..." Dash couldn't hold back her tears any longer, and soon, they all gave each other a group hug, just as they had done many times before.

Outside, the sun was still shining as always, and the train, now moving at full speed, continued steadily through the meadow.

As the pony friends shared a team hug, Magi watched them thoughtfully. "Was this the magic of friendship I had heard so much about?" Something inside the executive pegasus began to stir. She finally stood up.

"Forgive me for interrupting, but is it really alright for you to be so separated?" Magi said, standing in the middle of the aisle. Applejack and the others turned to look at her. At that moment, Magi still maintained a pleasant and understanding demeanor, but there was a slight hint of annoyance in her voice.

"What do you mean, dear?" Rarity asked.

"Girls, all of you form an incredible team and have achieved so much together. Many earth ponies, pegasi, and unicorns admire you throughout Equestria. So why not continue as a team and rule directly alongside Princess Twilight's throne?"

The quintet of friends looked at each other. After a few seconds of silence, Applejack was the one who responded, approaching Magi.

"Listen, Magi, it's true that each of us has great talent, and it's also true that we've accomplished many incredible things alongside Twilight. However, ruling Equestria in that way with her wouldn't be the right thing to do," Applejack declared.

"Why wouldn't it be the right thing to do? How could it not be?" Magi responded, almost indignant.

"When we met Twilight, she was on a mission to learn about the magic of friendship in our home, Ponyville. Since then, Twilight has started learning many friendship lessons from us. But we've learned from her as well. And one of the first lessons we learned is that everything has its place and time. Certainly, we'd all like to be by her side for longer. But if that were the case, over time, we'd become a burden, and it's very likely that it wouldn't allow her to grow into the great princess she can become. We want what's best for our friend. That's why in this case, we step aside," Applejack solemnly concluded while the rest of her friends nodded in silence, confirming what she had said.

Magi had an incredulous expression on her face after hearing this.

"Besides, none of us would know how to behave properly as royalty... Well, some of us would," Rarity's voice coughed behind Applejack. "Well, a few of us."

Laughter once again filled the train car as Rarity scolded the others. "But it's true!"

Magi watched the group of friends laughing together as one mare. It seemed like the conflict that had occurred just moments ago had never existed.

"I really..." Magi began, still incredulous, but she immediately restrained herself. "...I mean, I still can't quite understand it."

"It's not that difficult; it's like they say, 'If you love something, let it go,'" Applejack eloquently responded.

"NEVER!" Magi replied sharply. "Uh, I mean... I never quite understood that saying, letting go of what you love? Ha, ha, it really sounds silly, ha, ha." Magi had awkwardly altered her temperament. Applejack's words had unexpectedly struck a nerve in her, and without realizing it, she had shown her true self.

Applejack and the rest of the ponies looked at her strangely.

The executive pegasus began to back away nervously.

"Hey, are you okay?" Applejack asked.

"No... I mean, yes, yes, it's just that I just remembered I have another meeting. It's getting late!" Magi quickly diverted the conversation and began packing up all her presentation materials. Out of the corner of her eye, she briefly observed the other ponies. It wasn't good. They were starting to look at her with suspicion. She scolded herself. Things weren't supposed to go this way. She had planned to divide them as her main objective, and if that proved too difficult, at least she should earn their trust. But she hadn't achieved any of her goals, and now the image she had projected of herself was in jeopardy. She needed to retreat and rethink her strategy immediately.

"Oh, my goodness! I can't find my travel brochures. Could someone please open the windows? It's quite dark, and I can't see well," Magi said, feigning concern as she finished checking her suitcase. At the same time, she was already thinking about her escape, eyeing the hatch on the train's roof.

"The windows are already open," Pinkie Pie said, puzzled.

Magi and the other ponies also noticed it.

That was strange. It was barely past noon, yet outside it was as dark as if nightfall was imminent.

At that moment, the train's loud whistle sounded in the car, startling everyone. A moment later, chaos erupted.

Suddenly, the train had braked to a stop.

With no chance to react and propelled by inertia, the six ponies were pushed to one end of the car, crashing into each other. The lights went out, and all that could be heard was the screeching of the train's brakes as it came to a halt. It continued for several more seconds until it finally stopped.

Inside the darkened train cars, confusion and fear reigned among the passengers. Darkness also prevailed outside.

In the pony friends' car, the situation was no different.

"Girls, are you okay? Ouch, my wing!"

"Can you get off me?"

"I can't feel my tail!"

"Muuuuh... I have... a... hoof... in my mouth!"

"Mmmmmm mmmm mmm mmm"

Dash was the first to react. She pushed whoever was on top of her and, with no light, fumbled for the train's emergency switch. Soon, the car was bathed in a red light, revealing the chaotic state of the ponies.

As she had suspected, Fluttershy had been on top of her. Dash had pushed her aside, and Fluttershy was now sitting in one of the seats, still dazed. Further back were the rest of her friends, caught in a tangle of limbs and manes.

"It's not time to rest, Fluttershy!" Rainbow Dash scolded. "Let's help the others. Now!"

"Yes, yes..." Fluttershy said, still dazed. She shook her head immediately and, somewhat recovered, helped Dash untangle their pony friends.

They soon got the rest of their friends to their feet.

"Cough, cough, Thank heavens!" Rarity said gratefully to the two pegasi. She was the first to stand up and had pulled Applejack's lower-left hat out of her mouth.

"Thanks, Fluttershy! But I still can't feel my tail..." Pinkie Pie said apologetically as she got up with Fluttershy's help. Indeed, her fluffy tail had lost a lot of its volume. Dash didn't pay much attention to her as she helped Applejack.

"What a slam. Are you all okay?" Applejack quickly recovered. Although she had ended up beneath everyone, it didn't seem to have affected her much, and she hadn't lost her hat. In part, Pinkie Pie's tail had cushioned the impact of the train's sudden stop.

"Well, I'm all in one piece. The rest..." Dash responded, looking behind her. Her friends were gathered around Rarity. The unicorn had lit up her horn and was now the only visible light source. The emergency lights had failed at some point, making the situation more difficult for her friends. Thus, the rest of the car was in darkness.

"Don't worry, Applejack. We're just a little dazed from this terrible accident," Rarity said, examining her friends and the remains of the luggage on the floor with the light from her horn. "However, our luggage... look at this mess! Wait... where is my vanity case?! My imported beauty items!"

"Okay, everyone's fine, now we should..." Applejack began, ignoring Rarity's growing panic.

"Wait, everyone? Isn't someone missing?" Pinkie Pie suddenly interjected.

Then, the five ponies noticed that Magi was not with them. After a quick search around them, Fluttershy was the first to notice. "Look at that," the frightened pegasus said, pointing her hoof toward a huge yellow sphere located over the seats at the other end of the car.

Surprised by the unexpected discovery, the puzzled ponies looked at each other. However, Dash and Applejack were the first to take the initiative. With just a couple of glances, they seemed to reach an agreement and both began to advance toward the mysterious object, followed by the others.

They approached slowly. It was quite an unusual object; more like a giant egg, large enough for a pony to fit inside. Applejack, who had gotten close enough, noticed that there was a message written on its surface and began reading it aloud: "High-Intensity Impact Protection Capsule - Average C, Uh?" the farm pony expressed confusion.

At that moment, like a deflating balloon, a hiss came from the giant egg, and it began to lose volume. The figure of a pony emerged slowly from the deflating egg's skin. Then, one end tore open, and a disgruntled pegasus emerged from it.

"Ugh! Gross! Those tech incompetents. Cough! I told them to include air fresheners inside the capsule. Cough!" Magi complained as she moved away from the remnants of the capsule, emitting a foul smell of rotten eggs. "Never mind... What the hay was that?"

Magi exchanged glances with the other ponies. They were very surprised. The executive pegasus had irritated eyes and a furious look that overshadowed any memory of the kind and understanding image she had shown just moments ago. After looking at each other for a few seconds, Magi quickly turned away and then looked back.

"Phew! You're all safe!" Magi said with a futile smile that tried to hide the obvious irritation she felt.

Dash was the first to speak.

"Don't bother trying to keep up the act, Magi. We don't need that now," the pegasus said seriously. Magi quickly looked at the others. The stern looks on their faces indicated they were on the same page as Rainbow Dash.

After hesitating for a few seconds, Magi sighed and returned to a serious, cold expression that seemed more natural on her. "Alright, what did I miss? What's going on?"

No one answered her. A creaking sound came from the rear door of the car, catching everyone's attention. Soon, the door was engulfed in a bright pink magic, from which emerged the figure of a pony. Barely visible due to the intense light, they soon realized it was no ordinary pony.

The light faded, and before them stood an enigmatic and unfamiliar pony. This stern-looking pony had short pink hair, the same color as their eyes, divided by a thick brown bang. They wore polished black alicorn armor that seemed to shine with its own light. On the chest of their dark armor, the reliefs of a silver tree surrounded by six stars were visible, and a bright pink gem was embedded in their neck. They were a stallion, no doubt, but they looked younger than any of the present company. With an imposing step, this young stallion advanced toward the stunned group of ponies.

"GREETINGS, BEARERS OF THE ELEMENTS OF HARMONY. PLEASE, ACCOMPANY ME TO AWAIT THE CONCLUSION OF YOUR DESTINIES," Badwhiz Starheart said with a voice that made everyone, including Magi, feel a chill down their spines.
