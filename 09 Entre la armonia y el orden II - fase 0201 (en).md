"Poof." The group of pony friends landed with a dull thud, with Pinkie Pie sprawling on top of them. The teleportation spell had been successful, but at the last second, before the spell could complete, Pinkie Pie had made an impulsive leap, disrupting Twilight's magic. Her reckless action, combined with the spell's unique circumstances, caused a rebound effect, leaving them all tangled up in a chaotic heap.

"Ugh... Pinkie!" Twilight groaned from beneath the pile of ponies, all tangled and disoriented.

"Oops, sorry... Waaaaaa!" Pinkie Pie responded, trying to stand up but wobbling to the side due to dizziness.

"Keep it down, y’all might..." Applejack grumbled, annoyed as Pinkie, still dizzy, toppled over her again. Finally managing to steady herself, Applejack looked around in surprise. "What in tarnation is going on?"

Though still shielded by Twilight's magical bubble, it was clear their location had changed.

"Don’t worry, Applejack. We haven’t been discovered. This is my anti-surveillance bubble combined with the teleportation spell. No one will be able to track where we’ve gone," Twilight explained as she used her magic to help her friends get back on their hooves.

"That’s all fine and dandy, Twilight, but... we’re back on the train!" Applejack exclaimed in alarm. Everyone, except for Twilight, looked around in dismay and quickly realized they were indeed back in the same train car where they had previously met Vanilla.

The car was just as messy as they had left it. One of the doors leading outside was still slightly ajar, though not wide enough for anyone outside to notice the ponies’ sudden reappearance on the train.

"Don’t worry, girls. This is all part of the plan… I think it’s time I explain the plan," Twilight said. She gently waved her horn, and the magical bubble surrounding them began to expand, seamlessly adhering to the train car's surfaces. From the outside, there was no visible change at all.

[---]

Outside the train, the Cocatriz Titanicus lay sprawled across the meadow. Its massive head peeked timidly from beneath its folded wings as it hummed a sleepy, clucking tune. From afar, the gigantic creature appeared to be lost in a deep daytime slumber.

However, trusting that surface impression would be a catastrophic mistake.

The Cocatriz Titanicus was not asleep, nor was it drowsy or lethargic. Quite the opposite—it was fully alert, keenly attuned to the possibility of an enemy’s approach. Contrary to common intuition, that relaxed posture was actually its way of staying vigilant, waiting for some unwitting adversary to draw near, believing they could attack it easily—unaware of the devastating counterattack that awaited them.

This apparent calm was, in truth, a trap. A calculated deception stemming from the orders it had received from those responsible for the dire situation the captive ponies were now enduring within the great barrier.

"Stay still and keep watch," the creature had been commanded by its masters. And also: "Listen well, creature. If you find Princess Twilight and her allies... destroy them." That final order had been accompanied by a vivid mental image of its targets.

The colossal Cocatriz ruffled the feathers on its neck at the memory. It hated taking orders, especially when they didn’t come from its true master. It also despised being referred to as a "beast." It had a name: Beak.

Until not long ago, Beak had been an ordinary cocatriz. However, its master’s companions had used strange magic to transform it into the immense creature it was now. The transformation left Beak feeling uncomfortable in its own body, though its master had assured it that everything was fine. Even so, Beak wasn’t convinced. It had noticed a change in its master. The once kind and affectionate being it remembered had grown cold, harsh, and dark.

Why had its master changed? Was it because of those ponies? Had they hurt him somehow?

If that were the case... then Beak wouldn’t hesitate to crush them. Perhaps by doing so, its master would return to the way he once was, smiling at Beak the way he used to.

Beak smoothed the feathers on its wings and adjusted its head. The light around it was bothersome; after all, it was a nocturnal creature. But that pale brightness would not be an obstacle when it came time to hunt its prey and unleash its full fury upon them.

[---]

In Equestria, there exists a wide variety of magical creatures of different shapes and sizes. One of these species is the Cocatriz, a nocturnal predator that inhabits the dark, untamed forests of the realm, with a particular presence in the Everfree Forest. The body of this creature combines an upper half resembling a farm bird with a lower half exhibiting dragon-like traits. It has the ability to petrify its prey before carrying it back to its nest to feed. Though it is an exceptionally aggressive creature, it rarely attacks ponies outside its known habitat. The most serious cases involving these creatures are the occasional petrification incidents.

However, that's the present. In the past, the situation was far more perilous.

Many moons ago, before Celestia and Luna imprisoned Discord, the Lord of Chaos, the two princesses embarked on a crusade to rid Equestria of the terrible monsters that haunted the realm: black dragons, greedy minotaurs, nine-headed hydras, and other malevolent creatures. During their journey, the princesses faced numerous threats. However, one of the first challenges they had to overcome in their youth was eradicating the Cocatriz Titanicus from the kingdom. This immense creature, of unknown origin, terrorized the outskirts of Canterlot. It had developed a taste for ponies and was responsible for numerous disappearances of travelers and soldiers. Its influence in the kingdom grew to such an extent that even ordinary Cocatrices began to imitate it, flying boldly in broad daylight and spreading fear among farmers and townsfolk.

Filled with courage and accompanied by seasoned hunters, the noble princesses resolved to end this state of unrest by hunting the beast. After a journey fraught with hardships that tested their skills and determination, they finally managed to corner the creature in a cave, where they sealed it inside a cocoon of pine sap, leaving it trapped there to this day.

Of course, this is the version of the story that Celestia often recounts when asked about these matters. And it’s true. However, Luna tends to correct her, adding certain details that Celestia conveniently omits or excuses herself from remembering clearly.

One of these "forgotten" details involves Celestia acting as bait and spending an entire day inside the giant bird’s crop.

There were many such stories that Twilight had come to learn from her mentors. And while she felt a strong desire to share them with her friends, the pressing situation they were in forced her to set those tales aside and get straight to the point.

"... At the end of last year, I attended a presentation by Ocellus at the School of Friendship titled 'The Impact of the Cocatriz in the Everfree Forest.' Her research covered a wide range of topics related to Cocatrices, such as their diet, migratory habits, role in the ecosystem, and more. But one of her most remarkable discoveries was about their unusual anatomy. In addition to confirming that their species has an artificial origin caused by magic, she uncovered anomalies in the Cocatriz’s body that make them vulnerable to certain conditions.

One of these anomalies is the existence of a nerve node beneath the pharynx, which protrudes slightly through the skin and, when pressed externally, can paralyze their entire body. This is their weak point, and it’s precisely where we need to strike to defeat the Cocatriz Titanicus. Even though it’s much larger and stronger than any of its relatives, I’m confident it shares the same weaknesses as a common Cocatriz."

When she finished, the ponies who had been listening intently to Twilight fell silent. Despite the holographic images that had accompanied the explanation, the atmosphere inside the train car was heavy with doubt and unease. Applejack scratched the back of her neck, while the rest of her friends displayed expressions of confusion.

"So... we just have to hit it in the neck?" Applejack finally asked, her tone skeptical.

"It would be more like a massage under its chin," Twilight corrected.

"Under its cheeks!" Pinkie Pie exclaimed, bouncing in her seat.

"Exactly, Pinkie!" Twilight responded enthusiastically, like a teacher praising her star pupil. However, behind her feigned excitement, she was starting to worry about her friends' lack of energy.

"Uhhhh," Applejack muttered, while Fluttershy fidgeted nervously in her seat.

Several seconds of awkward silence passed.

"So... one of us has to give that overgrown bird a cheek massage?" Applejack asked, her concern evident.

"Chin, darling, chin would be the correct term," Rarity interjected, having been quiet until now. "And I'm sorry, Twilight dear, but... none of us can possibly do such a thing!"

Yes, that was the most logical reaction. No ordinary pony in their right mind would attempt something so reckless against a predator of that size. However, Twilight believed otherwise. Her friends were many things, but ordinary was definitely not one of them.

"One of you can do it," Twilight said confidently, her gaze falling on the pony sitting slightly behind the others.

All eyes turned to the pony Twilight was referring to. There sat Fluttershy, curled up in a seat. With everyone's attention on her, the timid pegasus seemed to shrink even further, but after swallowing hard, she said, "Okay, Twilight, I'll do it."

"Fluttershy, I understand if you have doubts and don't feel ready to—wait? You're agreeing?" Twilight asked, stunned by her friend's assertive response. She had expected much more resistance from Fluttershy.

"Hello! Are you Fluttershy?" Pinkie Pie interjected with her usual enthusiasm, looking at the pink-maned pegasus.

Fluttershy nodded timidly. "Yes, it’s me."

"Are you sure? Because the Fluttershy we know would be a little more scared about doing something as dangerous as this," Pinkie Pie said, raising an eyebrow and eyeing her skeptically.

Fluttershy lowered her gaze, feeling cornered by the attention she was receiving. However, after a moment, she raised her head with determination. "You all know me very well, and yes, it’s true—I should be terrified, and I am. I'm scared of what might be happening to Rainbow Dash. I'm scared of what might be happening to the other ponies who left the train. I'm scared for my forest friends and everyone in Ponyville. But right now, Rainbow Dash is out there, focused and giving her all to protect us from Vanilla. It wouldn’t be fair if I didn’t do the same. That’s why I want to do this—so we can all get out of here together and go home."

As she spoke, small tears began to well up in Fluttershy’s eyes. She bit her lower lip, revealing the genuine emotions she had been keeping inside until now.

The group fell silent at her words, except for Pinkie Pie, whose expression shifted from cheerful to deeply concerned.

"I’m so sorry, Fluttershy! I really am! I shouldn’t have joked like that! Forgive me, Fluttershy! Forgive meeeeeee!" Pinkie Pie cried out, panicking at the sight of her friend’s tears. She began sobbing right alongside her.

Applejack and Rarity moved closer, placing their hooves on Fluttershy to comfort her. They shared the same feelings of empathy and admiration.

Twilight, for her part, hesitated before stepping forward. Her face reflected her own bitterness. More than anyone, she was acutely aware of the danger Rainbow Dash was facing. She had seen a similar scenario before. The enemy knew they would work together but also understood how vulnerable they could be if separated...

Shaking off those thoughts, Twilight pushed aside her fears and joined her friends.

"You’re not alone, Fluttershy. We’ll all give our best. We’ll get out of here... together," Twilight said, spreading her wings to wrap them around her friends in a protective embrace.

"I know, Twilight. I’m sorry. I think I’m still not used to being brave. Even after everything we’ve been through... I still act like this," Fluttershy replied, embarrassed.

"You have nothing to apologize for, Fluttershy. You’re a wonderful friend, and you always remind us how important it is to be compassionate," Rarity added soothingly.

"That’s true. And we wouldn’t trade you for a million brave Fluttershys," Applejack said with a warm smile.

The group hug lasted a few seconds longer before they finally broke apart. However, Pinkie Pie stayed close to Fluttershy, looking at her with a pleading expression.

"It’s okay, Pinkie Pie. I forgive you," Fluttershy said gently.

At that moment, Pinkie embraced her joyfully, setting off one of her confetti bombs and filling the train car with tiny colorful paper pieces.

The heartfelt moment had passed, and everyone returned to their seats.

"So, what now?" Applejack asked, turning her attention to Twilight.

"Well... Rarity, did you pack your emergency fashion design tools?"

"Always, Twilight," Rarity replied confidently, opening her suitcase. Out emerged a pristine collection of sewing tools, perfectly organized by size and sparkle.

"Then let’s get started," Twilight announced, as determination began to shine in the eyes of her friends.

[---]

Part of Twilight's plan involved using all the available resources in the train car to craft clothing and prepare equipment for their confrontation with the Cocatriz Titanicus. Of course, this confrontation would mostly serve as a distraction since the primary task would fall on Fluttershy. She would need to fly up to the beast's neck and, once there, press its weak spot to defeat it. A mission of such magnitude might typically require days of planning and preparation, but for these ponies, who had faced even greater challenges in the past, this was just another day saving Equestria.

Following Twilight's instructions, Applejack and Pinkie Pie began dismantling the train car’s seats and part of its floor. Meanwhile, Fluttershy and Twilight sorted through the resulting materials, and Rarity polished and reshaped them with her magic, following the improvised designs she had sketched.

In just ten minutes, more than half the train car had been stripped down, and all of Rarity and Twilight’s designs had gone from paper to reality.

It had been an extraordinary effort.

"Great job, girls," Twilight said, wiping beads of sweat from her brow as she opened a bottle and poured a glass of soda for each of her friends.

"Yeehaw! That was quicker than raisin’ a barn!" Applejack exclaimed, downing her drink in one gulp. Meanwhile, the rest of the ponies sipped their drinks calmly, catching their breath amidst the remnants of the train’s seats.

"It’s not my finest work under pressure, but... it will certainly impress my audience!" Rarity declared proudly, dabbing her forehead with a handkerchief. Behind her, stacks of gear she had crafted were piled neatly. It was no exaggeration to say her work had been impressive. In such a short time, she had created an entire line of lightweight, fire-resistant outfits tailored perfectly for each of her friends.

The others knew this well and could do nothing but nod cheerfully in agreement with Rarity’s words.

"Well, if by 'your audience' you mean the giant pony-eating rooster-dragon outside, uhm... I’d say it’s getting a little impatient," Pinkie Pie remarked, peeking out the window.

Outside, the Cocatriz Titanicus had lifted its head, though it didn’t seem to be looking at them, but rather at something on the horizon.

Seeing this, Twilight immediately understood what was happening. The moment to act had arrived.

"Get ready, ponies. Operation 'Runway' begins now," Twilight said with determination.

At once, they all stood up. Using her magic, Twilight began distributing the equipment they had prepared. Applejack, Rarity, and Pinkie Pie donned transparent visors that matched their coat colors, insulated boots, white capes, and other items designed for battle. Twilight wore a similar outfit, though hers was more intricate. Fluttershy, on the other hand, wore the simplest set of all, save for a special earring identical to the one Twilight had previously given to Rainbow Dash.

With all the ponies in position and the remaining equipment ready, Twilight dispelled the magical barrier around the train car and, without further delay, gave the signal to move out.

[---]

Beak was restless. He had started sensing a presence inside one of the train cars, which was unusual since he hadn't felt anything since he began keeping watch. If his senses weren’t deceiving him, the presence didn’t seem large but rather something small… perhaps a mouse?

Suddenly, a different sensation overcame him from the other end of the barrier. It was an intense emotion, laden with distress. Beak stretched his neck, looking in that direction. His feathers bristled; there was no doubt—his master was under attack. Driven by an urgent need to protect his true owner, the massive rooster-dragon rose to his feet, ready to come to his aid.

“PUFFFFF,” a sound suddenly echoed.

It wasn’t an explosion but rather an unexpected jolt—a revelation.

Beak turned his head. The train car beside him literally collapsed: all its walls crumbled into rubble on either side, exposing a dismantled interior.

However, the car wasn’t entirely empty. A purple pony with wings and a horn stood in the wreckage, staring coldly at him. Beak recognized her instantly. She was the pony he’d been warned about—the one responsible for all the chaos happening.

Beak’s anger began to build, a torrent that finally erupted as searing flames.

The stream of fire roared for several seconds before finally subsiding. Beak surveyed the charred remains of the train car, certain his target had been reduced to ashes. But then, through the smoke and ash, a purple light began to shine. To his shock, the pony was still there, completely unharmed within a bubble of magic.

The bubble dissipated, and the purple pony rose above him in a flash of magic.

Beak wasn’t used to this. That little pony was infuriating. His fire hadn’t harmed her, and now she was staring down at him with an expression that almost looked… happy. Insolent. Beak’s fury grew even more. If his fire couldn’t destroy her, then he’d crush her with his claws.

The mighty rooster-dragon spread his enormous wings, preparing to take flight. His focus was entirely on the pony, so he didn’t notice the small barrels that had rolled underneath him.

Suddenly, a series of explosions erupted beneath his feet, accompanied by a rain of glittering confetti. Beak stumbled back, startled but unhurt. As he tried to spread his wings, he realized they were covered in sticky white ribbons that restricted his movements. Below him, small white figures, resembling mice, scurried about, scattering more ribbons in every direction.

Beak’s fury peaked. He unleashed a torrent of fire that scorched the meadow and part of the nearby train, obliterating the white mice. But they were quickly replaced by colorful ponies. Beak recognized them: they were the princess’s accomplices. They, too, needed to be eliminated.

The dragon launched into a relentless assault, spewing fire and chasing them with his claws. From above, the princess attacked him with magical beams, interrupting his every attempt to capture her allies.

The frantic battle raged on. The ponies hurled projectiles from the ground while the princess kept him occupied from above.

But the ponies’ efforts seemed futile. Beak was too strong, and their attacks barely fazed him. His endurance was immense, while the ponies began to tire. Soon, he would finish them all.

Then, something changed. Beak started to feel strange. A dizziness forced him to stagger, and a peculiar pressure built up in his throat. He tried to reach for his neck, but paralysis spread through his limbs, immobilizing him. Everything around him began to spin.

Fear overtook him. Beak didn’t understand what was happening, but that emotion was soon replaced by a warmth that slowly enveloped him.

As he succumbed to inevitable unconsciousness, he stretched his wings in a final attempt to reach a mysterious light in the sky. In it, the image of his master appeared—the only one who had cared for him. Remote like a dream, the smile of a pink-maned pony was the last thing Beak saw before falling into darkness.

[---]

Elsewhere…

Inside an oval-shaped chamber, bathed in the warm luminescence of an imposing golden orb, four figures stood deep in contemplation. Their gazes were fixed on the images reflected in the enchanted pool at their feet.

They were the esteemed members of the Knights of Order, considered the highest authorities among the six influential races of the blessed kingdom of Cunabula.

Taranis (Ophiotaurus), whose form combined the majesty of a bull with the agility of a serpent, exuded an aura of serene strength. Morrigan (Urutaú), an imposing bird with dark eyes and white plumage, projected a magnetic presence. Ceridwen (Quetzalkan), with vibrant feathers in shades of red and green, possessed avian traits in her upper half, while her lower half displayed the elegant silhouette of a serpent. Towering above them all was Mannah (Akhtubut Qirshin), with his small gelatinous body and pulpy tentacles contrasting sharply with the dark, shark-like lower limbs that supported his elevated throne, always adorned with his distinctive turbaned hat.

Each of them had been chosen by the stars, following an ancient tradition, to represent the inherent power of their respective races and to safeguard the prosperity of their nation.

However, the current situation defied the ideals they had steadfastly upheld throughout the ages.

"This does not bode well," Taranis remarked simply.

His sentiment was shared by all the knights present, who watched the scene unfolding in the enchanted pool at the center of the room. This water mirror, capable of revealing specific places within the great barrier, had been used by the knights to monitor Twilight and her friends ever since they had been confined.

Now, the pool showed the last and greatest of their pawns—meant to defeat the princess and her allies—succumbing… to a neck massage.

Although no one voiced it aloud, they all shared the same thought: they had underestimated the ponies.

The silence couldn’t last. It was then that the least concerned of the Knights of Order decided to speak.

"Oh, great sub-leader! I fear your attempt to take the initiative has taken an unfortunate turn. What do you plan to do about it?" Morrigan teased, her tone dripping with mockery.

Mannah, seated at the far end of the chamber, remained silent for a few seconds before rising on his cartilage-like limbs. In a solemn tone, he declared, "Given the recent circumstances, immediate control measures are necessary… I must employ the crystal of direct possession."

These final words were not directed at Morrigan or Taranis but to the other member of the Knights of Order who had remained silent on his left until now.

Ceridwen, bearer of the Element of Equity, did not hold Mannah in high regard. More than anyone, she knew that beneath his diplomatic façade lay a petty and insincere individual—in short, a politician.

"Due to the position you hold, I am obligated to follow your orders. However, as a member of our illustrious order, I would suggest that it be our companion Morrigan who uses the crystal. She possesses greater expertise in mastering the mind and spirit," Ceridwen responded firmly, her tone carrying a subtle undertone of defiance.

This bold remark cast a shadow across Mannah’s gelatinous form. Not long ago, he had promised the rest of the knights that, unlike the previous leadership of Danu, he would give greater consideration to the opinions of others. If he were to impose his will now, he might lose the trust of his peers—a risk he couldn’t afford in their current predicament. With no other option, he would have to overlook Ceridwen’s defiance for the moment.

"Of course, companion Ceridwen. Your counsel is valuable," Mannah replied, masking his irritation as he returned to his seat. "Do you agree with this proposal, companion Morrigan?"

"Completely," Morrigan replied, feigning humility.

"Very well. Then proceed and show those ignorant ponies of Equestria the true power of Cunabula!" Mannah commanded with fury.
