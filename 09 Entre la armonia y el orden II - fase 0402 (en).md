Mannah, Morrigan, Ceridwen, and Taranis watched in silence, their eyes fixed on the dramatic event about to unfold.

Under the vigilant gaze of her companions, Balor’s true body stepped forward to the center of the chamber, where a massive orb overflowing with pure magic awaited her. Surrounding it, six intricately designed crystals orbited with precision, gleaming like small stars around a sun. Each crystal bore a unique emblem, shimmering with an otherworldly glow.

With a firm motion, Balor extended her claws, as if attempting to crush an invisible sphere. In an instant, the magic surrounding her began to condense, pulling the crystals toward her. Slowly, they merged into a single, dazzling fragment.

The war chamber was flooded with blinding light, a burst of power that made the air tremble and put everyone on high alert.

Mannah, with a solemn voice filled with determination, proclaimed: "Let justice prevail!"

[---]

A column of black light rose into the sky of the Great Barrier, further darkening the already dim illumination and casting an eerie glow across various points within the magical dome.

Twilight-Dash was no stranger to such signs, and without hesitation, she set off toward their source.

Meanwhile, in the war chamber before the Knights of Order, the most crucial phase of their operation had begun. The Blazon of Unity, a legendary magical amulet, had been assembled. This artifact, used in decisive battles against enemies that had threatened their kingdom, was now being deployed for only the second time beyond their borders.

Inside the Great Barrier, Badwhiz’s real body began to transform. The purple armor covering the pony darkened, turning as black as tar. Every wound, mark, and sign of weakness vanished as an immense amount of magic poured into his body, surrounding him with a spectral aura. This transfiguration was the result of the combined magical energies of the five Knights of Order merging with Badwhiz, fusing them into one. However, it was an imperfect union—Danu, the bearer of the Element of Loyalty, was absent. Even so, the power Balor had gathered at that moment was more than enough to face the opponent that was fast approaching.

Twilight-Dash arrived at the source of the black light just as the transfiguration had reached completion.

A burst of dust filled the air.

The sky and the interior of the Great Barrier returned to their usual state, but everything had changed. A palpable tension spread through the air, like the ominous prelude to an impending storm.

[---]

Twilight-Dash watched her opponent atop the hill with dismay. The immense power she felt before her was impossible to ignore. It was like standing before a volcano in full eruption.

The cloud of dust that enveloped the area dissipated in an instant.

Balor, now in complete control of Badwhiz’s body and wielding the combined power of six individuals, appeared before Twilight-Dash. She spread her black wings with calculated calm and smiled—not a mocking or arrogant smile, but one of accomplishment. The satisfaction of someone who had seen every one of her plans come to fruition. Everything she had predicted had led her to this precise moment. Now, within the framework of her own machinations, only one task remained: to complete her mission.

Thus, while Twilight-Dash watched her, Balor mentally reviewed the steps that had led her to this point:

*Convince her comrades to join her cause and isolate Danu. Done.
*Capture her primary target and secure him. Done.
*Complete the preparations to neutralize the Lord of Chaos. Done.
*Prepare the means to destroy Equestria should everything fail. Done.
Finally, capture the irrelevant bearers of the Tree of Harmony’s magic. Pending.

Balor exhaled slowly. Of the six bearers she needed to capture, four were already in her grasp. The remaining two stood before her, now fused into a single entity.

"Great minds think alike… don’t you agree, princess?" Balor mocked, breaking the silence between them.

Twilight-Dash, startled, tried to identify the new voice now emanating from Badwhiz’s body. A distant memory surfaced in her mind, and then she understood.

"Balor!" Twilight-Dash exclaimed, narrowing her eyes as she recognized the threat before her. In Twilight’s independent mind, the pieces of the puzzle began falling into place rapidly. Meanwhile, from her own thought space, Dash simply scoffed, "Great minds… ha."

"Surprised? Didn’t I warn you that one day we would finish our mission?" Balor replied coldly.

"Please, we don’t have to take it this far. There are other—" Twilight-Dash attempted, making an effort to reason with Balor.

"‘Other things more important than home’?" Balor interrupted, her tone sharp.

They were the very same words Twilight had once used to lecture Ceridwen after her defeat in Canterlot. That memory, shared with her comrades, had only fueled Balor’s contempt.

"What ‘things’ are you referring to, princess?" Balor continued. "In my home are my friends, my family, my love, my purpose, my history, my nation…"

A cold wind blew between the two opponents. The atmosphere grew even heavier. Balor descended toward Twilight-Dash, carried on the wings of a fury she had held back for far too long. Until now, she had remained composed, but not anymore.

"Answer me, princess… WHAT COULD BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT?!" Balor roared, her voice crashing like thunder as the rock beneath her shattered.

Twilight-Dash did not answer.

"I had considered sparing you, for the sake of maintaining peace in this kingdom… but now that I understand your true capabilities, that would be a terrible mistake. I WILL SHOW YOU NO MERCY, DAMN YOU! DON’T EVEN BOTHER ASKING FOR IT!"

The explosion of pure, unfiltered rage left Twilight-Dash frozen for a moment. In Twilight’s independent mind, her opponent’s fury was tangible. Had she made a mistake? Where was this hatred coming from? What was she missing? But Dash interrupted her thoughts with unwavering certainty: "Now’s not the time for doubt, Twilight! These guys are wrong, and you know it. We’re fighting to save our friends and Equestria. That’s the only thing that matters!"

Encouraged by Dash’s words, Twilight-Dash steadied herself and stepped forward toward Balor.

"I won’t let you hurt my friends or the ponies of Equestria! You can still stop this! It’s not too late!" she declared with determination.

Balor stared at her in silence for a moment. She closed her eyes and, when she reopened them, every trace of anger had vanished. In its place was a deep, genuine sorrow.

"Poor, wretched princess… midnight has already fallen upon us. It’s too late for all of us," Balor murmured before launching her first attack at Twilight-Dash.

[---]

The dialogue was over. There was no longer any point of understanding or reason to waste time exchanging words. Balor launched her offensive with the sole intent of finishing off her opponent. Twilight-Dash, unfortunately, had no choice but to accept it and fight.

Balor charged directly at Twilight-Dash, using no spells or tricks. Her charge was meant to cause the maximum possible physical damage, counting on surprising her opponent, who would surely be expecting some preparatory spell. She also had the Starheart gem on her neck. With this in her favor, an immediate magical counterattack would not be possible.

Her assumption proved correct. Twilight-Dash, caught off guard, could only raise a magical barrier with great effort and take the hit with her hooves braced.

The clash between them caused the surrounding rocks to explode. There was a brief struggle between the two opponents—though it lasted only seconds, it felt like time stood still for them. One pushed against the other, a purple barrier resisting a fuchsia meteor attempting to break through. Both forces wavered until all the accumulated magical energy around them was finally released in a second explosion that devastated the area where they stood.

The new shockwave obliterated all remaining rocks from the previous impact. A massive dust cloud spread in all directions, covering half of the great barrier where they were trapped.

Badwhiz’s body, possessed by Balor, was sent flying from one end of the cloud.

However, Balor did not lose consciousness. Still in the air, she performed an agile maneuver, spinning on herself and stopping her fall with the strength of her artificial alicorn wings. Without wasting a second, she soared even higher and searched for her opponent among the explosion’s remnants.

She clicked her tongue.

Below her stood Twilight-Dash, watching her with a cold gaze. There were signs she had also been pushed back, but they were merely scratches, just like the ones Balor now bore.

"Well... we're evenly matched," Balor thought to herself. The previous attack, though inelegant, had given her the information she needed to continue her strategy. It was now clear that physically, they were equal. Even if she reinforced her armor or added more equipment, fighting hoof-to-hoof would only result in a stalemate. "If that's the case... then magic is the key."

Balor brought her front hooves together and assumed a meditation stance as she entered the explosion’s dust cloud. The darkness of the dust surrounded her. She knew that inside, she would be an easy target, so she immediately teleported without making another move.

In an instant, she reappeared at one of the barrier’s edges. Once again, she tracked Twilight-Dash, and just as she had assumed, she was circling inside the dust cloud where she had been moments before.

"You don't know tracking spells, do you?" Balor had studied this before, yet she was still surprised by how flawed Equestrian magic was. Despite its advances in so many fields, ponies had glaring weaknesses in areas like security and control.

"Too much time living in peace..." Balor murmured as she unleashed her spell. The ground began to tremble, and columns of water shot into the sky. Soon, much of the terrain was filled with geysers, flooding the plain. The newly formed crater from the previous explosion began to fill, taking the shape of a lake.

Balor’s keen senses sent an alert. Someone was approaching her at high speed. It was obvious who it was.

"That's right... come on, fool, come..." Balor thought as she prepared her next spells. Three columns of water shot up beside her, rising to the height where she floated. The water began to accumulate into three large bubbles that rapidly grew in size.

A sudden, fleeting glow—almost like a rainbow lightning bolt—rushed toward her. In less than a blink, Twilight-Dash appeared in front of her with an extended hoof, intending to strike her directly. It almost seemed as if she had teleported; however, Balor had not blinked, nor was she surprised.

Twilight-Dash's attack landed directly on Balor’s face, but the possessed pony’s body remained completely unharmed. The powerful blow had been entirely dissipated by a translucent layer of magical air surrounding Balor. The black-armored pony impassively drifted back a few meters. Balor, paying no attention to her opponent’s surprise at her defense, launched her counterattack. The water bubbles around her compressed, and three continuous high-pressure water blasts shot toward Twilight-Dash at a terrifying speed. Nearly grazing some of her feathers, Twilight-Dash gracefully dodged all the blasts. Balor had to admit it—she was too good.

Another spell was unleashed, and from Balor’s position, several air currents shot out at an almost hypersonic speed toward Twilight-Dash. Seeing her flanks under attack, Twilight-Dash dove toward the ground, allowing the air projectiles to strike it. Smaller explosions erupted across the plain in the path left behind by Twilight-Dash’s flight.

Balor continued her attack. The three water bubbles merged into one even larger sphere. Suddenly, the new bubble froze and began to expand. Growing larger and larger, the ice sphere covered the sky within the barrier. Below, Twilight-Dash finished dodging the remaining air projectiles and looked up. A frozen planetoid loomed above her. With a simple hoof movement, Balor sent it plummeting down.

If the Twilight-Dash fusion had only Rainbow Dash’s consciousness to respond to that attack, she would have charged straight through the giant ice sphere in a useless and arrogant display of strength and power. On the other hand, if only Twilight’s consciousness were present, she would have chosen to distance herself from the impact zone of that slow and predictable projectile and then analyze Balor’s intentions behind such an obvious attack.

However, Twilight-Dash was more than just the conceptual union of two ponies. She was amazing and righteous—more than that, she was EXCEPTIONAL.

With a speed even greater than it had taken to plan her next moves, Twilight-Dash soared into the sky. She flew over the surface of the massive ice sphere plummeting down and continued her flight until she reached Balor from behind, attacking her in the same manner as before. Once again, the attack was repelled, pushing Balor backward. However, this time Balor received an unexpected strike. Before she even noticed her opponent’s absence in front of her, a sharp pain surged through her entire body from below. The world spun around her. Trapped in a push at an utterly irrational speed, the body possessed by Balor was dragged across the skies.

Dismayed, Balor looked down and discovered that Twilight-Dash was the one biting her tail, pulling her down to hurl her toward the ground. In a reflex of rage at such insolence, Balor unleashed an electric bolt at Twilight-Dash, who stubbornly endured for several seconds before finally letting go.

But it was already too late. Balor, in a futile attempt to change her trajectory, extended her wings only moments before crashing into the ground. The possessed body of Balor bounced several times before finally coming to an abrupt halt.

“Damn you…!” Balor didn’t have time to finish expressing her fury. Directly above her, the massive ice sphere she had launched was just meters from hitting the ground. Twilight-Dash had pushed it precisely to ground zero of that catastrophic impact.

“BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR” resounded throughout the barrier. Once again, the landscape was changing. Hundreds of fragments of ice and rock were thrown into the sky only to fall like meteorites, and a massive cloud of dust and steam darkened the already trapped atmosphere, making it almost impossible to breathe. At one of the far ends of the barrier, where a faint light still shone through, a panting Twilight-Dash watched the cataclysmic impact.

“Rainbow Dash, that was…” began Twilight’s independent mind.

“Incredible… I know! I’ve never kept that speed up for so long! We should do this more often!” Rainbow Dash’s independent mind exclaimed excitedly.

“No! That was extremely dangerous! She could’ve counterattacked at the last second and left us buried under that mountain of ice!” Twilight’s independent mind scolded.

“Oh, come on! We’d just teleport out of there!”

“We can’t teleport, Rainbow!”

“Oh, right, that stone… Well, I’ll keep that in mind next time!” Rainbow Dash said confidently.

Twilight’s independent mind didn’t argue further. There was no point in reprimanding Dash any more for her reckless actions. Still, she was worried that Dash wasn’t focused enough to maintain the fusion. They both needed to be in sync, or else the fusion could fail mid-battle. If Rainbow Dash’s personality started to overshadow her own, she could temporarily lose her magic once the fusion ended. That had never happened before, certainly not during her advanced magic lessons with Celestia. But the possibility existed, and she couldn’t afford that risk, especially when their enemy had yet to reveal all her cards…

“Alright, I get it… I’ll be more careful. I wouldn’t want us to fail because of something like that,” Rainbow Dash responded, surprising Twilight’s independent mind.

“Wait, you heard everything I thought?” Twilight’s independent mind asked in surprise.

“I can hear everything you think. Isn’t it supposed to be that way?”

“Well, yes, but… I thought I had closed off my mind.”

“I think you’re the one getting a little distracted.”

Immediately, Twilight entered a state of mental isolation. Rainbow Dash was right. She had been lowering her own concentration mid-battle, unintentionally allowing Rainbow’s mind to take the lead. With a deep breath, her focus returned, and the fusion stabilized once more.

“I’m sorry. I’m not used to fighting like you. Not in this way…”

“Don’t worry, Twilight. Just trust my experience. Traveling the world has given me a lot of it.”

“Alright, I—”

“Up!” Twilight-Dash instinctively shouted upon sensing a light at the highest point of the barrier.

Far above the barrier, Balor hovered in the air like a small fuchsia and black lantern. The possessed body of Badwhiz had only scratches and minor injuries. However, Balor’s spirit was greatly disturbed.

“Ahh… Ahh… Damn it…” Balor panted, sweat dripping from her forehead. It was no surprise—just moments ago, she had managed to teleport in the last millisecond before that icy planetoid crashed onto her head. Everything could have ended right then and there, and she would have been forced to take more extreme measures to finish the battle.

Balor looked down and once again locked eyes with Twilight-Dash.

“Well! That was… very dangerous… No matter, everything is ready now,” Balor muttered to herself as she observed the changes in the landscape. She took another deep breath and slowly descended toward Twilight-Dash. Balor was already visualizing the final moves to end this battle.

Twilight-Dash watched her opponent descend until she landed on the ground just a few meters away. However, Twilight-Dash’s senses were on high alert. She could feel that Balor was calm and unscathed. That was bad—her opponent’s confidence meant everything was going exactly according to plan. That likely meant the situation was about to get much worse for her.

Those forebodings were answered by an abrupt whistle on the horizon. Where the massive ice sphere had fallen, a thick white mist was now emerging, starting to spread across the ground within the barrier. The mist, which had a milky and almost liquid appearance, advanced accompanied by an extreme cold that reminded Rainbow Dash’s independent mind of the frigid plains of the Arctic.

“Cold… too cold,” Twilight-Dash thought to herself. Inside, the independent thoughts of both ponies began to worry.

A super-chilled air current rushed between the two opponents. Twilight-Dash shivered. Balor noticed her opponent’s weakness but did not gloat in the slightest. She had no interest in doing so at that moment—not against an opponent like her. The horn on the armor equipped to Balor’s possessed body ignited, and immediately, a new spell was set in motion. Icy winds accompanied by thunder began to rage within the barrier, heralding the terrible blizzard of ice and snow that was about to be unleashed. Balor knew well the weakness ponies had to the cold, and she would use that advantage against her opponent. Igniting a golden fire over the body she controlled, Balor prepared for the hoof-to-hoof battle that was coming.

Twilight-Dash narrowed her eyes. She was definitely in for a rough time.

In the distance, amidst the rising blizzard, a faint pink butterfly watched the outside from one of the derailed train cars.

[---]

In the war room of the Knights of Order, everyone watched the scene reflected in the enchanted pond. None of them had words to describe the sheer ferocity of the brutal confrontation taking place at that moment.

Blurred by the blizzard, the images showed Twilight-Dash relentlessly striking Balor. Her attacks caused bursts of fire that consumed everything around them: trees, rocks, and even the water itself was engulfed in flames. Yet, Twilight-Dash continued her assault with headbutts and kicks. But Balor was not passive. Every attack was met with a counterstrike of ice that slowed her opponent down, followed by lightning bolts that looked like authentic currents of light.

All of this was happening in the middle of a blizzard at extreme freezing temperatures and with almost no visibility.

Then, Taranis lifted his head and looked at the rest of his companions, who had not taken their eyes off the pond.

"Balor has really changed..." he murmured to himself.

He had known Balor for a long time. His first mission outside had been with her, and he clearly remembered how cold and distant her company had been. The mission was a success, but he had expected 'the master' to have more charisma.

In the following missions, he concluded that Balor was not the kind of person who would sacrifice herself for others, but rather a calculated individual who would abandon a mission if the risks became too great.

That was back in those days, but now...

Balor had behaved differently during the current mission. She had joked with Ceridwen, with Mannah, the sub-leader, and even seemed to get along well with Morrigan.

Was it because of the change in leadership, since Danu was no longer the leader?

No.

Taranis, bearer of the element of pride, turned his gaze back to the pond. With his own eyes, he could see how Balor was giving it her all in battle, like a true warrior spirit putting her life on the line. He felt envious. Perhaps his companions did too.

"When we finish the mission and return home, I'll tell the new recruits about..." Taranis thought.

But then, a great sorrow returned to the warrior's heart. The battle had made him forget.

He bit his tongue and refocused on the fight. The tragedy that had occurred the previous midnight should not cloud his spirit.

There was no longer a home to return to.

[---]

The terrible storm of ice and snow that had raged inside the barrier where Twilight and her friends were trapped was finally beginning to subside. After about ten minutes of continuous combat, both opponents were exhausted, staring at each other intently.

Under the pale sunlight that managed to filter through the great barrier, the figures of both adversaries were clearly revealed.

On one end was Balor, possessing Badwhiz's body, visibly damaged. The armor, which until recently had protected him from most attacks, now showed deep cracks and significant damage. Although Balor could use magic to heal the wounds of the body she occupied, doing so would deplete her own energy reserves, reducing her chances of success. Knowing that the end was near, she opted to conserve her power.

Facing Balor, Twilight-Dash was not in much better condition. Her body bore bruises and visible wounds, but the most evident damage was in her wings. The constant exposure to Balor's attacks and the fury of the blizzard had left much of her wings burned or frozen. Although she was still capable of flight, her speed had been significantly reduced, and Twilight-Dash knew that was exactly what her opponent had aimed for from the beginning.

Balor relaxed her stance and smirked. She knew the battle was not yet over, and the princess might try to heal herself or unveil a new spell. But in her mind, victory was already assured. All that remained was to execute her final move.

"You seem happy, Balor. Have you already won?" Twilight-Dash asked with a defiant tone.

"Heh heh heh... No, princess of naivety, not yet. But we're very close to putting this unpleasant encounter to an end," Balor replied mockingly before disappearing in a flash of magic.

She had teleported.

"Damn," Twilight-Dash murmured, frustrated. She had invested much of her physical energy trying to take down Balor during the storm, but none of her attacks had been effective enough. Again and again, her opponent had resisted or evaded her assaults with a combination of spells and cunning. Despite this, Twilight-Dash still had an ace up her sleeve: her source of magic remained untouched.

Thanks to the Starheart gem, which blocked the use of spells, her reserve of magical energy was still full. This gave her the confidence to withstand any attack Balor might launch, even if it meant consuming all her magic. She knew she had to wait for the perfect moment to surprise her with a burst of pure power when Balor thought she had already won.

"But even so..."

"Twilight, it's all or nothing. We got this!" exclaimed Rainbow Dash's independent mind enthusiastically.

"Yes, together!" Twilight's independent mind responded determinedly.

[---]

In the distance, atop a barren hill, Balor observed the frozen landscape.

The stage was set.

The water had awakened.
The wind had awakened.
The earth had awakened.

Only the final act remained.

Balor exhaled deeply. A brilliant, almost radiant green light began to manifest around the hooves of the pony she was using as a puppet: Badwhiz Starheart. This earth pony, whom Balor had used as a test subject for her experiments, had taught her much—not only about the history of ponies and the magic they had discovered, but also about the magic that remained hidden from them.

"Garden of Eternity! Haaaa!" Balor exclaimed forcefully, raising her front hooves and striking the ground with determination. While she didn’t actually need such dramatic gestures to cast the spell—concentrating and gathering magic was enough—these theatrics helped reinforce her confidence and set the pace of the battle.

This was the beginning of the end.

Balor felt her inner magical reserves start to drain. It wasn’t a fatal loss, but it was noticeable. This spell was her trump card, an extremely costly resource she had kept secret for years. Neither her masters, nor the great patriarch, nor anyone in Cunabula knew that she had managed to master this magic. Even the other Knights of Order had only a vague idea of the spell Balor was about to unleash to defeat the princess.

A sudden wave of mental fatigue struck Balor, causing her real body to waver slightly. In the oval chamber where her comrades were gathered, the atmosphere filled with concern.

"You don’t need to push yourself so hard. If you need us to transfer some of our strength to you, just say the word," Mannah suggested, watching Balor’s growing exhaustion with concern.

"Silence, Mannah. Keep watch and let me finish this task," the Draco-Dragon responded coldly.

This was the final stretch. This was the plan Balor had imposed on her comrades. Despite the fatigue and exhaustion, she had both the duty and the magic necessary to press forward.

[---]

A cracking sound spread throughout the Great Barrier, and little by little, the signs of an imminent earthquake began to manifest.

Twilight-Dash immediately took to the air. Her wings, though somewhat injured, didn't seem as damaged as she had initially thought. Even so, she remained cautious of her opponent’s next attack.

Was she finally going to face Danu, leader of the Knights of Order? Deep inside, Twilight was no longer sure she had the strength to maintain a conversation, let alone fight him.

The ground began to crack open while the wind blew with increasing force.

As she observed the desolate landscape below, Twilight couldn't help but think that she had never been born to be a warrior...

"Wow, so now it’s that empty-headed ‘leopony’s’ turn. What’s he gonna do now? Try to trap us with a giant rock or something?" Rainbow Dash’s independent thoughts scoffed.

"I don’t think so. He already threw a giant ice block at us a little while ago. It’s very likely his attack will be different this time," Twilight responded.

"Whatever, I just hope this is the last thing they try so we can free our friends."

Twilight remained silent. Analyzing the rhythm of the battle, everything seemed to indicate that this was the final stage of the fight. After this...

The entire ground within the Great Barrier began to shake with violent seismic waves. The layers of ice, previously formed by the blizzard, shattered as if they were fragile cookies being crushed. A new white mist of vapor rose, concealing the ground. This time, however, the mist was lighter and more diffuse, allowing glimpses of the cracks and the collapsing terrain.

Twilight-Dash ascended a bit higher to stay beyond the mist’s reach.

After several minutes of rumbling and shaking, the turmoil finally ceased. Little by little, the mist began to dissipate, revealing a completely transformed landscape.

Twilight-Dash blinked several times, bewildered. She rubbed her eyes and looked down again.

"Well... I wasn't expecting this," she said out loud.

Inside the Great Barrier, where a desolate and devastated wasteland had once stretched, there was now a vast celestial forest covering the entire area. Tall silver trees with sky-blue leaves rose toward the heavens like giant pines covered in a glistening dew. There were no signs of darkness, corruption, or malice. On the contrary, the forest looked healthy, magical, and could even be described as sacred.

Among the trees, circular clearings revealed a lush, green forest floor. At the center of each clearing, large golden flowers shaped like tulips were arranged in what appeared to be a delicate, giant floral pattern.

Twilight-Dash couldn’t hide her bewilderment. This was a "beautiful" forest, but it didn’t give her the impression of being threatening or hiding any danger. She flew around the Great Barrier multiple times, expecting an attack, but nothing happened. After several minutes of searching in vain for Balor, she finally stopped near the remnants of the train, which were still visible.

"I don’t get it. Does she expect us to be dumb enough to go down there and get caught? Or are these flowers some kind of trick?" Twilight-Dash wondered aloud.

Luminous on the ground below her, the golden flowers seemed harmless, but something about their glow and the way they were arranged in perfect circles made them look unnatural. Something didn’t add up in this scene, but Twilight-Dash couldn’t quite pinpoint what it was.

"...I hope they’re not an apology. Because if they are, I won’t accept it," she murmured to herself.

"No, princess. These flowers are to adorn your grave," a voice suddenly replied.

Twilight-Dash immediately turned around. Several meters behind her, Balor watched her with a sinister smile.

"Do you like them?" Balor continued mockingly.

"They’re very beautiful, but they don’t seem appropriate for a funeral," Twilight-Dash replied, instantly raising a magical shield around herself.

Balor, upon seeing the barrier, let out a mocking laugh.

"Really, naïve princess? Even knowing that I possess this powerful amulet, you think using magic is a good idea?" she said with sarcasm.

Twilight-Dash didn’t respond. She remained alert, ready for any hostile move.

"Let me guess. By not using any of your magic during the fight, you were hoping to build up enough power for a counterattack when I was fatigued or showed a weakness," Balor continued, maintaining her mocking tone but showing no offensive intent.

"You’ve kept that shared mental possession going for too long. I know that ability causes great fatigue, and those who overuse it can end up losing their ability to use magic altogether."

"How considerate of you to remind me of the risks! But don’t think for a second that it will change my intentions," Twilight-Dash responded sarcastically.

"If that’s the case, then..." Balor started to say, but her words were suddenly cut off. The magical barrier that Twilight-Dash had raised unexpectedly vanished.

Noticing this, Twilight-Dash quickly backed away and tried to raise the shield again. However, it disappeared once more. She repeated the attempt, but the result was the same. From a distance, Balor stopped smiling and watched her coldly.

A cold sweat ran down Twilight-Dash’s forehead. Balor hadn’t moved closer, and yet, her magic was failing. Slowly, a feeling of heaviness began to take over her body. Her wings, which she had relied on so much, flapped clumsily, struggling to keep her in the air. Panic started creeping in.

"You know, it was quite surprising to learn that in Equestria, there are plants capable of dispelling the mind-controlling magic of my companion Morrigan. In Cunabula, we also have similar plants... Even some that can nullify magic entirely," Balor remarked in a reflective tone.

Twilight-Dash glared at her in anger as she slowly descended. What she had just said could easily be a lie, yet there Balor was, floating effortlessly with magic, contradicting her own words.

"You!" Twilight-Dash tried to shout, but it was already too late. Her wings and the rest of her body lost strength, tilting sideways like a wounded bird. After an erratic flight, her figure began to plummet toward the radiant celestial forest below.

[---]

She was falling. She was losing everything.

A shiver ran down Twilight-Dash’s spine as the magic within her began spiraling out of control. At first, it had been just a numbness, but now it had turned into genuine torture.

Every strand of magical energy burst inside her, short-circuiting through her own nerves, leaving a trail of excruciating pain. It was as if a fundamental part of her being was being torn apart by thousands of invisible cuts.

As she descended, panic swelled in her chest, pressing down on her more and more. Her mind fought desperately against the terrifying thought of losing what was supposed to be an essential part of her essence. She shut her eyes tightly, as if that could somehow stop the gravity pulling her inexorably toward the ground.

"No... this can't be happening," she whispered. Yet, her words were barely audible over the ominous hum of the wind and the dying magic within her.

She opened her eyes again. The surface, covered in celestial trees, was rushing toward her at a terrifying speed.

Her heart pounded frantically, as if trying to compensate for the imminent loss. Though physically unharmed, Twilight-Dash felt torn apart inside. How could she face Balor without her magic?

Losing her wings was already devastating. Losing her magic meant losing everything.

In the thin, distorted air, she desperately searched for any remaining threads of magic within her. But it was useless. The feeling of helplessness wrapped around her like a shadow, and as she fell, a sharp pang of anguish pierced her chest.

"No... not like this. Not yet," she murmured. Her eyes welled up with tears as she accepted the cruel reality—she was defenseless, and Balor knew it.

Her strategy had failed, and now she was one step away from the end.

Then, her body crashed through the thick canopies of the celestial trees. Finally, Twilight-Dash struck the ground.

[---]

"Twilight, this is serious!" exclaimed Rainbow Dash’s independent mind.

"I know!" Twilight replied with the same intensity.

"TWILIGHT, THIS IS REALLY SERIOUS!"

"I KNOW, RAINBOW DASH! I KNOW!" she snapped, her voice filled with frustration.

After crashing, Twilight-Dash sprinted through the dense celestial forest. She tried flapping her wings, but they refused to lift her. Her body felt strangely clumsy and uncoordinated. Though the stabbing pains had subsided, each breath was an exhausting effort.

She stumbled and fell face-first into a muddy puddle surrounded by red tulips. A wave of nausea surged through her as she got up, but she managed to hold it back.

What was this place? Why did everything feel so unnatural? Twilight-Dash scanned her surroundings with anxious eyes, desperately searching for answers that could shed light on this strange forest. She had no idea what kind of magic was being used against her. Despite Twilight and Rainbow Dash’s vast experience, they had never faced anything like this before.

The only remotely similar situation was when Twilight traveled to a world without magic through a mirror. However, even then, the discomfort of being unable to use magic was comparable to having a stuffy nose. This time, the unease was far worse, like slowly drowning in a pit of burning tar while all her senses warped around her.

"We still have our magic inside us; that’s what matters," noted Twilight’s independent mind, striving to stay calm as they continued trotting forward.

Though the last remnants of magic she could sense were faint, Twilight was convinced that the magic was still within them. She knew it was there, even if she couldn’t connect to it. It had to be... because if it wasn’t...

"Fine, but we still can’t fly," Rainbow Dash lamented.

"We can’t use spells or magical abilities," Twilight continued, making a futile attempt to ignite Twilight-Dash’s horn.

"AND WE CAN’T FLY!"

Twilight-Dash came to an abrupt halt as they reached a clearing surrounded by large rocks. She remained alert for several minutes, but there were no signs of anyone approaching. She let out a small sigh. A brief moment of calm—that was all she needed.

Her vast mind got to work immediately.

Twilight was certain that a pegasus' ability to fly was linked to the elemental magic that surrounded their wings. At that moment, Twilight-Dash’s wings seemed to be in good condition and filled with magic.

So why couldn’t they fly?

She studied the mystical forest around her. It was clear that this place was to blame. Every corner radiated magic so powerful and unnatural that it seemed to twist reality itself…

Twilight-Dash pushed her mind to the limit, trying to unravel the mystery. The forest was interfering with their magic somehow, and she needed to understand and counteract it as soon as possible. Balor could attack at any moment.

"Arcane flows, magic channelling, catalysts..." she murmured hastily, hugging herself as her mind raced at full speed.

She dug deep into her memories—basic lessons from magic school, countless travels, even the bedtime stories she was told as a filly. She searched for answers, even in the most outlandish rumors she had ever heard.

Nothing.

Twilight-Dash pushed herself harder, her concentration so intense it felt like smoke might start coming out of her head. And then, she found something: a zebra.

"Without magic, you say? Why do you keep repeating that to me?" That was the eloquent response Zecora had given when Twilight asked her how other creatures lived in a world without magic. Zecora, with her vast knowledge and travels through distant lands, had learned to handle enchantments despite not possessing innate magical abilities.

"Unicorn magic is channeled through their horns, pegasus magic through their wings... from the inside out," murmured Twilight-Dash, recalling Zecora’s words.

"And what about from the outside in?" teased the zebra’s memory.

The idea was absurd. Channeling magic from the environment almost always led to chaotic results. To do so, one needed amulets, talismans, or even living beings as catalysts. A direct flow of magic of that nature was like trying to catch a worm underground without getting dirty at all.

But Zecora had attempted something different and, surprisingly, had achieved promising results. Twilight had tried to imitate her under her guidance, but her efforts ended in complete failure.

A bitter expression crossed Twilight-Dash’s face.

She had abandoned Zecora’s lessons out of frustration when she couldn’t make any progress. Even though she knew the basics and meditation postures perfectly, she had never been able to produce results. She never shared that experience with her friends. She thought it wasn’t important... but deep down, she knew the truth: she felt ashamed.

Another mistake. How many things had she been neglecting?

"From the outside in... come on," she told herself with determination. She had a hunch. Her magic wasn’t being absorbed or blocked. She could feel it flowing in the wrong direction. But reversing that flow would be a monumental challenge.

The alicorn adopted a meditation posture, closing her eyes as she tried to connect with the magic within her. A numbing sensation began to envelop her, and soon she felt the magic flowing... outward.

"No!" Twilight-Dash exclaimed upon realizing she was rapidly losing part of the magic she had accumulated.

"Hey, shouldn’t we find shelter first? This place isn’t safe," Rainbow Dash’s independent mind suggested, trying to be helpful.

"We don’t have time anymore, Rainbow!" Twilight’s independent mind snapped in frustration. "Balor will catch up to us..."

Indeed, time had run out.

"Ayyyyyyyyyyy..."

A powerful blow struck her head at that very moment. Twilight-Dash cried out in pain as she was sent flying through the air, crashing into a tree that split in two.

Balor, no longer invisible, had no intention of being merciful. She summoned chains that shot toward Twilight-Dash. The alicorn, still trying to recover from the previous attack, was ensnared by the thick chains, left completely incapacitated. She barely managed to move one of her front hooves. With great effort, she shifted just in time to dodge a powerful lightning strike that struck the ground where she had been.

But it wasn’t enough. A second bolt was launched at her, hitting her directly and weakening her even further.

Twilight-Dash began to be dragged. Balor pulled the chains toward her, like a spider reeling in its prey.

"It’s over, princess. End your fusion, and your friend’s life will be spared," Balor threatened, keeping Twilight-Dash under her control. Of course, it was obvious Balor was lying.

"NOT YET!" Twilight-Dash roared, making the chains creak as she freed one of her front hooves. Then, she unleashed a concentrated dust blast around her, pushing back.

A futile protest. Balor didn’t even flinch. The attack dissipated like smoke. Claws of dark magic emerged from Balor’s sides and seized Twilight-Dash midair.

"Then I’ll tear your soul apart and give whatever remains to your friend before I execute her!" Balor growled.

The claws constricting Twilight-Dash pulled at her forcefully, and a mass of light began to emerge from her body. The sheer terror on Twilight-Dash’s face said it all. It wasn’t physical pain—it was something far worse.

Desperate, she tried to concentrate, but she could feel her strength fading bit by bit.

"Twilight, snap out of it, Twilight!" Rainbow Dash’s independent mind called out in distress, her friend no longer responding. "Don’t give up, Twilight!"

[---]

"Don't give up, Twilight!"

But Twilight was no longer listening, nor had she given up.

From the deepest part of her being, Twilight entered a state of deep meditation, immersing herself in a simulated space within her mind. This was her last card, the final move she could make to save her friends from total defeat.

It was a virtual reality, an imaginary place where she could create possible scenarios based on all the knowledge she possessed. More than a magical ability, it was a mental discipline that only someone like her could have developed after so many years of study and dedication. Even so, this exercise required a passive consumption of magic to function; the fact that it was working at that moment was proof that magic was still within her.

Twilight expanded her mental focus, and slowly, reality began to take shape.

In the past, she had used this ability to visualize the possible future of her friends. This time, she would use it to conclude what she had left unfinished long ago.

Just like back then, when she trained with Zecora in the Everfree Forest. She stood on a pond, balancing her body on the water, with calm and steady breathing. She perceived all the magic around her with her eyes closed.

Twilight felt the water. Twilight felt the wind. Twilight felt the earth.

But Twilight did not feel the forest.

The Everfree Forest had existed long before the founding of Equestria. It had a dark and scattered history: stories of malevolent creatures that inhabited it, stories of princesses who walked through its clearings, stories of unimaginable treasures and sinister secrets.

But Twilight still did not feel the forest.

Why couldn’t she feel the forest? She perceived with her magic the movement of the wind, the water, and the earth, but not the forest. The forest was hidden. It did not speak to her. It was not there...

Twilight opened her eyes again. She was failing. It was the same result she had obtained when training with Zecora.

The simulated space in her mind began to darken.

She felt like a failure. She couldn’t save her friends. The enemy had been right in front of her, and she hadn’t seen it. After the battle against the Villainous Trio, she had promised everyone: "It won’t happen again."

But it had happened again.

The simulated space in her mind darkened even further.

Twilight looked at her own reflection in the water, doubtful. Now she was a princess. Back in those training days, she had been just a unicorn.

Everything had been so simple in those days.
Wings and a horn. How extraordinary! Now they were useless against the threat that had cornered her. She also had hooves, but all ponies had those.

Twilight’s thoughts faded even further...

"Applejack is more responsible with her farm than I am with Equestria," Twilight reflected aloud to herself. "At least she has backup seeds in case of disasters. I, on the other hand, only have escape plans..."

She remembered the moment Applejack planted a new orchard after a storm. Applejack rejoiced, saying things like, "These new apple trees will be even better than the last ones, I’d bet my left hind leg on it!"

Twilight smiled at the memory, though she never really thought the new apples were any better.

"Look at them grow, haha, I could stay up all night waiting to see the first sprout," Applejack continued speaking. And she wasn’t joking. On many occasions, Twilight had caught her friend sleeping in the middle of the orchard.

"Oh, yeah! Look at them grow! Just like in my parents’ rock farm," confirmed Pinkie Pie.

"Rocks don’t grow, Pinkie. They just emerge from the ground due to geological shifts. Even I know that," Rainbow Dash replied.

"But it would be nice if they did. If diamonds could grow bigger..." Rarity fantasized.

"A rock forest also grows larger, and watching it grow is lovely; bears like to play there..." Fluttershy added, but no one paid attention.

No one except Twilight.

"...they help the rock trees grow by bringing stones from far away and placing them on top of each other. That’s how they create a new rock tree, teaching their cubs, and in the future, more bears come to play in it."

A lump formed in Twilight’s throat.

The distant vision of her friends cheerfully strolling through Applejack’s farm brought tears to her eyes. These were the memories she cherished most.

And they were also the key to solving the mystery of the sky forest.

Zecora had told her something like: "Feel the elements and nature. Listen to how they breathe, see how they grow, follow their flow..."

Twilight closed her eyes. She dispelled her thoughts and focused on just one. She needed to change her approach. She couldn’t follow the flow of magic; instead, she needed to let magic find its own flow within her.

"From the outside in." A block of stone took shape in Twilight’s mind. A brown stain emerged in the darkness.

"From a seed in the earth." Another block of stone took shape. Another brown stain appeared in the darkness.

"It grows toward the sky." One more block of stone took shape. From the brown stain, a tiny green dot was revealed.

"And opens its leaves to the stars!" The green dot was now a sprout in the earth...

Twilight opened her eyes.

Sweat cascaded down her forehead and all over her body. She wasn’t tired, but she was extremely tense. Then, she saw in front of her a small mound of stones.

She had done it. She had managed to feel a tiny part of the forest. She had experienced the process of making a seed grow.

"This felt very different from how Zecora described it. Maybe I didn’t understand her well because of her rhymes. Haha..." Twilight laughed; she wanted to jump for joy right there. But time was running out.

The small mound of stones crumbled.

"The bond to magically connect with nature must be different for each species... zebras have their way, ponies have another..." Twilight reflected.

But she had grasped the trick. Now it was a matter of replicating it over and over until she could finally make a tree grow.

"I can do it!" she encouraged herself.

Twilight would not give up.

[---]

Balor pulled hard once more. Half of Twilight's soul had already been extracted from Twilight-Dash's body.

"Just a little more..." Balor murmured to herself, calculating that in just twelve seconds, the extraction would be complete. The fusion would collapse, and then everything would be over.

Twilight-Dash, for her part, fought with all her strength. Her wings were busy keeping the chains at bay, while she desperately tried to reconnect Twilight's soul to her body with her front hooves. But it wasn't enough. The ethereal figure of her friend slipped through her hooves, like sand escaping from an hourglass. Time was running out.

"You won't take her! Huuuuuuuuuu!" cried Rainbow Dash's independent mind, trying to hold firm.

However, the process barely slowed, and Twilight-Dash's body grew more and more numb.

"Five more seconds..." Balor murmured with a triumphant smile, eager to finish the remaining moments. The last fraction of Twilight's soul was about to be completely torn away.

And then, something changed.

"Huh?" Balor frowned, puzzled. Two seconds had passed, but there was no progress.

She pulled harder. But this time, she couldn't move the soul even a millimeter.

No, it wasn’t just that Twilight's soul was resisting extraction. It was something worse. It was returning to her body.

"WHAT?!" Balor exclaimed, unable to believe what she was seeing.

Suddenly, Twilight-Dash opened her eyes. The expression of despair and exhaustion had vanished from her face, replaced by a firm and determined gaze. Her coat, which until a few seconds ago had looked dull and lifeless, began to shine once again with intensity. A renewed energy radiated from her. Magic had begun to flow through her body once more!

With a firm movement, "PAMMMM," Twilight-Dash landed forcefully on the ground. Until then, she had been suspended in the air, trapped in Balor’s magic, but now she was completely in control. She stood on the earth with determination, making it clear that she was no longer an easy target.

Balor took a step back, unable to hide the consternation washing over her. How could this be happening?

The battle had taken an unexpected turn.

Now she was the one in danger. She was within Twilight-Dash’s attack range, and at that moment, the alicorn possessed the greatest magical power. If Twilight-Dash used her extreme speed, she could charge at her with a critical blow.

Balor knew she could teleport or raise a magical barrier to avoid the attack, but both options would take time. With the chains still tangled and the extraction process incomplete, any action would take at least an extra second.

And in this instant, a second was too much.

[---]

Twilight-Dash smiled confidently. She could see Balor’s distress and knew exactly what she was thinking.

Inside her, Rainbow Dash was overflowing with excitement. "I don’t know how you did it, but this is amazing! I can feel my wings again!"

"Don’t celebrate just yet… I can barely hold this… we don’t have much time," Twilight’s independent mind responded, exhausted.

Twilight had spent hours practicing within her simulated mental space, where time flowed much more slowly. This wasn’t just the result of her magic and experience with these exercises; thanks to the special nature of her fusion with Rainbow Dash, Twilight could harness Twilight-Dash’s mental agility to enhance her own inner space. Now, that training was paying off.

However, despite the advantages of the mental realm, Twilight couldn’t ignore the strain. Eventually, she grew fatigued and had to return her consciousness to the normal flow of thoughts shared with Twilight-Dash.

When she came back, she was ready. She had achieved her goal: learning to establish a bond with nature. Even though she didn’t fully understand the ancient magic surrounding the celestial forest, she knew it was a living forest, and she could communicate with it.

In her mental space, she allowed the magic of the environment to flow into her, planting within herself the seed of a celestial tree. Soon after, the seed sprouted and grew into a young sapling. That was when Twilight finally heard the voice of the enchanted forest around her.

In her lessons with Zecora, the zebra had explained how trees sometimes whispered or softly spoke one’s name.

However, the celestial forest was very different.

A thunderous chant resonated everywhere. The celestial trees sang true hymns in a language unknown to Twilight, accompanied by a unique and harmonious symphony. Sometimes intense, other times gentle—even the fallen leaves on the ground followed the same rhythm. The sensation was unlike anything she had ever experienced, overwhelming in every way.

But she also felt something else… anger. A dense, bitter anger.

The forest was upset with her. Its voice rose in protest against her presence.

Twilight wasn’t entirely sure why, but she had a hunch and decided to try something. She opened her mental space once again, allowing the voice of the forest to reach the young celestial sapling she had created. Then, something unexpected happened.

A new voice emerged.

This new voice joined the trees’ song, and with it, all the hostility Twilight had felt disappeared.

Now, the forest allowed her to be among them. She didn’t feel like they were her friends… but at least they tolerated her.

If the situation weren’t so dramatic, Twilight might have cried from emotion.

"Wow! That happened? Turns out fantasizing about planting a singing tree was the key… makes sense," Rainbow Dash commented, still a bit confused as she processed Twilight’s memories.

"I’m so tired, Rainbow… it’s up to you now," Twilight weakly whispered before falling silent again. She hadn’t lost consciousness completely, but she was no longer able to speak while maintaining the mental space where the celestial sapling continued to sing.

Twilight was reaching her limit.

Now, it was Rainbow Dash’s turn to reach hers.

"Leave it to me!" Twilight-Dash exclaimed in Rainbow’s voice. She spun around, and the chains binding her tightened even more. The pressure visibly increased on Balor’s side.

[---]

The struggle was still ongoing, but Balor no longer had the initiative. If she retreated now, she would be caught in an instant. She had spent too much magic on the celestial forest, a trap the princess was never supposed to overcome. And yet, she had. How?

Balor had studied ponies in general and the circle of individuals surrounding Twilight. There was no record of any pony ever awakening floral magic at any point in history. Some ponies could make plants grow with spells, but that was due to their talent or the traditional use of magic they had learned. It was not the same method used in Cunabula. Even among the nations allied with Equestria, there were no similar precedents. Only in Cunabula was the ancient art of floral magic preserved in its purest form.

So how had the princess managed to appease the eternal forest? Had she discovered an unknown method in record time to communicate with it and subdue it?

Unheard of. Balor bit her inner lip.

She had summoned the forest with her magic. That was why the forest respected her—because it respected its summoner. Balor could delegate her honor to others, and the forest would respect them as well. But she could not rule over it. The forest had a will of its own and was magical; it would only obey someone who spoke its language and used its magic.

That person was in Cunabula at that very moment. Did the princess possess such power?

Sweat dripped down Balor’s forehead as she weighed the possibility and tightened the chains further.

"No," she told herself. "The princess must have tricked the forest or offered it a tribute. If this forest already obeyed her, this fight would be over."

The forest was powerful. If her opponent were Dana… ridiculous, it didn’t even make sense to think about it.

Meanwhile, Twilight-Dash began to expand the grip of the chains. The dark claws pulling at Twilight’s soul were losing strength. Balor had already lost half of her progress.

"What’s wrong? Why so quiet? Things aren’t going the way you wanted, are they?" Twilight-Dash taunted arrogantly. Now she had the upper hoof, her magic was intact, and Balor was weakening more with each passing second. Soon, she would break free and launch a counterattack.

Balor looked at her with a mix of rage and desperation.

Then… she smiled triumphantly.

"Don't worry… I'm already used to this!" Balor responded.

At that moment, the chains tightened once more. Twilight-Dash felt a sharp pain, but something else alarmed her… When she looked to her sides, she saw cracks beginning to form on her skin. They glowed with her inner light, but it wasn’t just light escaping… it was her magic!

"No! No! No!" Twilight-Dash repeated in panic. The fusion had reached its limit. Although Balor hadn’t managed to fully extract Twilight’s soul, she had kept it out long enough to destabilize the bond with Rainbow Dash. On top of that, the chains—designed to break magic—were intensifying the process.

Twilight-Dash was losing magic at an alarming rate. She had to strike now if she wanted any chance of success, but Balor was too far away. Time was running out.

Balor pressed harder. The chains were doing their job. She only needed to hold on a little longer and not release Twilight’s soul. Time would do the rest.

At the brink of catastrophe, only a miracle could save Twilight-Dash.
