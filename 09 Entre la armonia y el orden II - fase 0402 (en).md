Mannah, Morrigan, Ceridwen, and Taranis watched in silence, their eyes fixed on the dramatic event about to unfold.

Under the vigilant gaze of her companions, Balor’s true body stepped forward to the center of the chamber, where a massive orb overflowing with pure magic awaited her. Surrounding it, six intricately designed crystals orbited with precision, gleaming like small stars around a sun. Each crystal bore a unique emblem, shimmering with an otherworldly glow.

With a firm motion, Balor extended her claws, as if attempting to crush an invisible sphere. In an instant, the magic surrounding her began to condense, pulling the crystals toward her. Slowly, they merged into a single, dazzling fragment.

The war chamber was flooded with blinding light, a burst of power that made the air tremble and put everyone on high alert.

Mannah, with a solemn voice filled with determination, proclaimed: "Let justice prevail!"

[---]

A column of black light rose into the sky of the Great Barrier, further darkening the already dim illumination and casting an eerie glow across various points within the magical dome.

Twilight-Dash was no stranger to such signs, and without hesitation, she set off toward their source.

Meanwhile, in the war chamber before the Knights of Order, the most crucial phase of their operation had begun. The Blazon of Unity, a legendary magical amulet, had been assembled. This artifact, used in decisive battles against enemies that had threatened their kingdom, was now being deployed for only the second time beyond their borders.

Inside the Great Barrier, Badwhiz’s real body began to transform. The purple armor covering the pony darkened, turning as black as tar. Every wound, mark, and sign of weakness vanished as an immense amount of magic poured into his body, surrounding him with a spectral aura. This transfiguration was the result of the combined magical energies of the five Knights of Order merging with Badwhiz, fusing them into one. However, it was an imperfect union—Danu, the bearer of the Element of Loyalty, was absent. Even so, the power Balor had gathered at that moment was more than enough to face the opponent that was fast approaching.

Twilight-Dash arrived at the source of the black light just as the transfiguration had reached completion.

A burst of dust filled the air.

The sky and the interior of the Great Barrier returned to their usual state, but everything had changed. A palpable tension spread through the air, like the ominous prelude to an impending storm.

[---]

Twilight-Dash watched her opponent atop the hill with dismay. The immense power she felt before her was impossible to ignore. It was like standing before a volcano in full eruption.

The cloud of dust that enveloped the area dissipated in an instant.

Balor, now in complete control of Badwhiz’s body and wielding the combined power of six individuals, appeared before Twilight-Dash. She spread her black wings with calculated calm and smiled—not a mocking or arrogant smile, but one of accomplishment. The satisfaction of someone who had seen every one of her plans come to fruition. Everything she had predicted had led her to this precise moment. Now, within the framework of her own machinations, only one task remained: to complete her mission.

Thus, while Twilight-Dash watched her, Balor mentally reviewed the steps that had led her to this point:

*Convince her comrades to join her cause and isolate Danu. Done.
*Capture her primary target and secure him. Done.
*Complete the preparations to neutralize the Lord of Chaos. Done.
*Prepare the means to destroy Equestria should everything fail. Done.
Finally, capture the irrelevant bearers of the Tree of Harmony’s magic. Pending.

Balor exhaled slowly. Of the six bearers she needed to capture, four were already in her grasp. The remaining two stood before her, now fused into a single entity.

"Great minds think alike… don’t you agree, princess?" Balor mocked, breaking the silence between them.

Twilight-Dash, startled, tried to identify the new voice now emanating from Badwhiz’s body. A distant memory surfaced in her mind, and then she understood.

"Balor!" Twilight-Dash exclaimed, narrowing her eyes as she recognized the threat before her. In Twilight’s independent mind, the pieces of the puzzle began falling into place rapidly. Meanwhile, from her own thought space, Dash simply scoffed, "Great minds… ha."

"Surprised? Didn’t I warn you that one day we would finish our mission?" Balor replied coldly.

"Please, we don’t have to take it this far. There are other—" Twilight-Dash attempted, making an effort to reason with Balor.

"‘Other things more important than home’?" Balor interrupted, her tone sharp.

They were the very same words Twilight had once used to lecture Ceridwen after her defeat in Canterlot. That memory, shared with her comrades, had only fueled Balor’s contempt.

"What ‘things’ are you referring to, princess?" Balor continued. "In my home are my friends, my family, my love, my purpose, my history, my nation…"

A cold wind blew between the two opponents. The atmosphere grew even heavier. Balor descended toward Twilight-Dash, carried on the wings of a fury she had held back for far too long. Until now, she had remained composed, but not anymore.

"Answer me, princess… WHAT COULD BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT?!" Balor roared, her voice crashing like thunder as the rock beneath her shattered.

Twilight-Dash did not answer.

"I had considered sparing you, for the sake of maintaining peace in this kingdom… but now that I understand your true capabilities, that would be a terrible mistake. I WILL SHOW YOU NO MERCY, DAMN YOU! DON’T EVEN BOTHER ASKING FOR IT!"

The explosion of pure, unfiltered rage left Twilight-Dash frozen for a moment. In Twilight’s independent mind, her opponent’s fury was tangible. Had she made a mistake? Where was this hatred coming from? What was she missing? But Dash interrupted her thoughts with unwavering certainty: "Now’s not the time for doubt, Twilight! These guys are wrong, and you know it. We’re fighting to save our friends and Equestria. That’s the only thing that matters!"

Encouraged by Dash’s words, Twilight-Dash steadied herself and stepped forward toward Balor.

"I won’t let you hurt my friends or the ponies of Equestria! You can still stop this! It’s not too late!" she declared with determination.

Balor stared at her in silence for a moment. She closed her eyes and, when she reopened them, every trace of anger had vanished. In its place was a deep, genuine sorrow.

"Poor, wretched princess… midnight has already fallen upon us. It’s too late for all of us," Balor murmured before launching her first attack at Twilight-Dash.

[---]

The dialogue was over. There was no longer any point of understanding or reason to waste time exchanging words. Balor launched her offensive with the sole intent of finishing off her opponent. Twilight-Dash, unfortunately, had no choice but to accept it and fight.

Balor charged directly at Twilight-Dash, using no spells or tricks. Her charge was meant to cause the maximum possible physical damage, counting on surprising her opponent, who would surely be expecting some preparatory spell. She also had the Starheart gem on her neck. With this in her favor, an immediate magical counterattack would not be possible.

Her assumption proved correct. Twilight-Dash, caught off guard, could only raise a magical barrier with great effort and take the hit with her hooves braced.

The clash between them caused the surrounding rocks to explode. There was a brief struggle between the two opponents—though it lasted only seconds, it felt like time stood still for them. One pushed against the other, a purple barrier resisting a fuchsia meteor attempting to break through. Both forces wavered until all the accumulated magical energy around them was finally released in a second explosion that devastated the area where they stood.

The new shockwave obliterated all remaining rocks from the previous impact. A massive dust cloud spread in all directions, covering half of the great barrier where they were trapped.

Badwhiz’s body, possessed by Balor, was sent flying from one end of the cloud.

However, Balor did not lose consciousness. Still in the air, she performed an agile maneuver, spinning on herself and stopping her fall with the strength of her artificial alicorn wings. Without wasting a second, she soared even higher and searched for her opponent among the explosion’s remnants.

She clicked her tongue.

Below her stood Twilight-Dash, watching her with a cold gaze. There were signs she had also been pushed back, but they were merely scratches, just like the ones Balor now bore.

"Well... we're evenly matched," Balor thought to herself. The previous attack, though inelegant, had given her the information she needed to continue her strategy. It was now clear that physically, they were equal. Even if she reinforced her armor or added more equipment, fighting hoof-to-hoof would only result in a stalemate. "If that's the case... then magic is the key."

Balor brought her front hooves together and assumed a meditation stance as she entered the explosion’s dust cloud. The darkness of the dust surrounded her. She knew that inside, she would be an easy target, so she immediately teleported without making another move.

In an instant, she reappeared at one of the barrier’s edges. Once again, she tracked Twilight-Dash, and just as she had assumed, she was circling inside the dust cloud where she had been moments before.

"You don't know tracking spells, do you?" Balor had studied this before, yet she was still surprised by how flawed Equestrian magic was. Despite its advances in so many fields, ponies had glaring weaknesses in areas like security and control.

"Too much time living in peace..." Balor murmured as she unleashed her spell. The ground began to tremble, and columns of water shot into the sky. Soon, much of the terrain was filled with geysers, flooding the plain. The newly formed crater from the previous explosion began to fill, taking the shape of a lake.

Balor’s keen senses sent an alert. Someone was approaching her at high speed. It was obvious who it was.

"That's right... come on, fool, come..." Balor thought as she prepared her next spells. Three columns of water shot up beside her, rising to the height where she floated. The water began to accumulate into three large bubbles that rapidly grew in size.

A sudden, fleeting glow—almost like a rainbow lightning bolt—rushed toward her. In less than a blink, Twilight-Dash appeared in front of her with an extended hoof, intending to strike her directly. It almost seemed as if she had teleported; however, Balor had not blinked, nor was she surprised.

Twilight-Dash's attack landed directly on Balor’s face, but the possessed pony’s body remained completely unharmed. The powerful blow had been entirely dissipated by a translucent layer of magical air surrounding Balor. The black-armored pony impassively drifted back a few meters. Balor, paying no attention to her opponent’s surprise at her defense, launched her counterattack. The water bubbles around her compressed, and three continuous high-pressure water blasts shot toward Twilight-Dash at a terrifying speed. Nearly grazing some of her feathers, Twilight-Dash gracefully dodged all the blasts. Balor had to admit it—she was too good.

Another spell was unleashed, and from Balor’s position, several air currents shot out at an almost hypersonic speed toward Twilight-Dash. Seeing her flanks under attack, Twilight-Dash dove toward the ground, allowing the air projectiles to strike it. Smaller explosions erupted across the plain in the path left behind by Twilight-Dash’s flight.

Balor continued her attack. The three water bubbles merged into one even larger sphere. Suddenly, the new bubble froze and began to expand. Growing larger and larger, the ice sphere covered the sky within the barrier. Below, Twilight-Dash finished dodging the remaining air projectiles and looked up. A frozen planetoid loomed above her. With a simple hoof movement, Balor sent it plummeting down.

If the Twilight-Dash fusion had only Rainbow Dash’s consciousness to respond to that attack, she would have charged straight through the giant ice sphere in a useless and arrogant display of strength and power. On the other hand, if only Twilight’s consciousness were present, she would have chosen to distance herself from the impact zone of that slow and predictable projectile and then analyze Balor’s intentions behind such an obvious attack.

However, Twilight-Dash was more than just the conceptual union of two ponies. She was amazing and righteous—more than that, she was EXCEPTIONAL.

With a speed even greater than it had taken to plan her next moves, Twilight-Dash soared into the sky. She flew over the surface of the massive ice sphere plummeting down and continued her flight until she reached Balor from behind, attacking her in the same manner as before. Once again, the attack was repelled, pushing Balor backward. However, this time Balor received an unexpected strike. Before she even noticed her opponent’s absence in front of her, a sharp pain surged through her entire body from below. The world spun around her. Trapped in a push at an utterly irrational speed, the body possessed by Balor was dragged across the skies.

Dismayed, Balor looked down and discovered that Twilight-Dash was the one biting her tail, pulling her down to hurl her toward the ground. In a reflex of rage at such insolence, Balor unleashed an electric bolt at Twilight-Dash, who stubbornly endured for several seconds before finally letting go.

But it was already too late. Balor, in a futile attempt to change her trajectory, extended her wings only moments before crashing into the ground. The possessed body of Balor bounced several times before finally coming to an abrupt halt.

“Damn you…!” Balor didn’t have time to finish expressing her fury. Directly above her, the massive ice sphere she had launched was just meters from hitting the ground. Twilight-Dash had pushed it precisely to ground zero of that catastrophic impact.

“BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR” resounded throughout the barrier. Once again, the landscape was changing. Hundreds of fragments of ice and rock were thrown into the sky only to fall like meteorites, and a massive cloud of dust and steam darkened the already trapped atmosphere, making it almost impossible to breathe. At one of the far ends of the barrier, where a faint light still shone through, a panting Twilight-Dash watched the cataclysmic impact.

“Rainbow Dash, that was…” began Twilight’s independent mind.

“Incredible… I know! I’ve never kept that speed up for so long! We should do this more often!” Rainbow Dash’s independent mind exclaimed excitedly.

“No! That was extremely dangerous! She could’ve counterattacked at the last second and left us buried under that mountain of ice!” Twilight’s independent mind scolded.

“Oh, come on! We’d just teleport out of there!”

“We can’t teleport, Rainbow!”

“Oh, right, that stone… Well, I’ll keep that in mind next time!” Rainbow Dash said confidently.

Twilight’s independent mind didn’t argue further. There was no point in reprimanding Dash any more for her reckless actions. Still, she was worried that Dash wasn’t focused enough to maintain the fusion. They both needed to be in sync, or else the fusion could fail mid-battle. If Rainbow Dash’s personality started to overshadow her own, she could temporarily lose her magic once the fusion ended. That had never happened before, certainly not during her advanced magic lessons with Celestia. But the possibility existed, and she couldn’t afford that risk, especially when their enemy had yet to reveal all her cards…

“Alright, I get it… I’ll be more careful. I wouldn’t want us to fail because of something like that,” Rainbow Dash responded, surprising Twilight’s independent mind.

“Wait, you heard everything I thought?” Twilight’s independent mind asked in surprise.

“I can hear everything you think. Isn’t it supposed to be that way?”

“Well, yes, but… I thought I had closed off my mind.”

“I think you’re the one getting a little distracted.”

Immediately, Twilight entered a state of mental isolation. Rainbow Dash was right. She had been lowering her own concentration mid-battle, unintentionally allowing Rainbow’s mind to take the lead. With a deep breath, her focus returned, and the fusion stabilized once more.

“I’m sorry. I’m not used to fighting like you. Not in this way…”

“Don’t worry, Twilight. Just trust my experience. Traveling the world has given me a lot of it.”

“Alright, I—”

“Up!” Twilight-Dash instinctively shouted upon sensing a light at the highest point of the barrier.

Far above the barrier, Balor hovered in the air like a small fuchsia and black lantern. The possessed body of Badwhiz had only scratches and minor injuries. However, Balor’s spirit was greatly disturbed.

“Ahh… Ahh… Damn it…” Balor panted, sweat dripping from her forehead. It was no surprise—just moments ago, she had managed to teleport in the last millisecond before that icy planetoid crashed onto her head. Everything could have ended right then and there, and she would have been forced to take more extreme measures to finish the battle.

Balor looked down and once again locked eyes with Twilight-Dash.

“Well! That was… very dangerous… No matter, everything is ready now,” Balor muttered to herself as she observed the changes in the landscape. She took another deep breath and slowly descended toward Twilight-Dash. Balor was already visualizing the final moves to end this battle.

Twilight-Dash watched her opponent descend until she landed on the ground just a few meters away. However, Twilight-Dash’s senses were on high alert. She could feel that Balor was calm and unscathed. That was bad—her opponent’s confidence meant everything was going exactly according to plan. That likely meant the situation was about to get much worse for her.

Those forebodings were answered by an abrupt whistle on the horizon. Where the massive ice sphere had fallen, a thick white mist was now emerging, starting to spread across the ground within the barrier. The mist, which had a milky and almost liquid appearance, advanced accompanied by an extreme cold that reminded Rainbow Dash’s independent mind of the frigid plains of the Arctic.

“Cold… too cold,” Twilight-Dash thought to herself. Inside, the independent thoughts of both ponies began to worry.

A super-chilled air current rushed between the two opponents. Twilight-Dash shivered. Balor noticed her opponent’s weakness but did not gloat in the slightest. She had no interest in doing so at that moment—not against an opponent like her. The horn on the armor equipped to Balor’s possessed body ignited, and immediately, a new spell was set in motion. Icy winds accompanied by thunder began to rage within the barrier, heralding the terrible blizzard of ice and snow that was about to be unleashed. Balor knew well the weakness ponies had to the cold, and she would use that advantage against her opponent. Igniting a golden fire over the body she controlled, Balor prepared for the hoof-to-hoof battle that was coming.

Twilight-Dash narrowed her eyes. She was definitely in for a rough time.

In the distance, amidst the rising blizzard, a faint pink butterfly watched the outside from one of the derailed train cars.

[---]

In the war room of the Knights of Order, everyone watched the scene reflected in the enchanted pond. None of them had words to describe the sheer ferocity of the brutal confrontation taking place at that moment.

Blurred by the blizzard, the images showed Twilight-Dash relentlessly striking Balor. Her attacks caused bursts of fire that consumed everything around them: trees, rocks, and even the water itself was engulfed in flames. Yet, Twilight-Dash continued her assault with headbutts and kicks. But Balor was not passive. Every attack was met with a counterstrike of ice that slowed her opponent down, followed by lightning bolts that looked like authentic currents of light.

All of this was happening in the middle of a blizzard at extreme freezing temperatures and with almost no visibility.

Then, Taranis lifted his head and looked at the rest of his companions, who had not taken their eyes off the pond.

"Balor has really changed..." he murmured to himself.

He had known Balor for a long time. His first mission outside had been with her, and he clearly remembered how cold and distant her company had been. The mission was a success, but he had expected 'the master' to have more charisma.

In the following missions, he concluded that Balor was not the kind of person who would sacrifice herself for others, but rather a calculated individual who would abandon a mission if the risks became too great.

That was back in those days, but now...

Balor had behaved differently during the current mission. She had joked with Ceridwen, with Mannah, the sub-leader, and even seemed to get along well with Morrigan.

Was it because of the change in leadership, since Danu was no longer the leader?

No.

Taranis, bearer of the element of pride, turned his gaze back to the pond. With his own eyes, he could see how Balor was giving it her all in battle, like a true warrior spirit putting her life on the line. He felt envious. Perhaps his companions did too.

"When we finish the mission and return home, I'll tell the new recruits about..." Taranis thought.

But then, a great sorrow returned to the warrior's heart. The battle had made him forget.

He bit his tongue and refocused on the fight. The tragedy that had occurred the previous midnight should not cloud his spirit.

There was no longer a home to return to.

[---]

The terrible storm of ice and snow that had raged inside the barrier where Twilight and her friends were trapped was finally beginning to subside. After about ten minutes of continuous combat, both opponents were exhausted, staring at each other intently.

Under the pale sunlight that managed to filter through the great barrier, the figures of both adversaries were clearly revealed.

On one end was Balor, possessing Badwhiz's body, visibly damaged. The armor, which until recently had protected him from most attacks, now showed deep cracks and significant damage. Although Balor could use magic to heal the wounds of the body she occupied, doing so would deplete her own energy reserves, reducing her chances of success. Knowing that the end was near, she opted to conserve her power.

Facing Balor, Twilight-Dash was not in much better condition. Her body bore bruises and visible wounds, but the most evident damage was in her wings. The constant exposure to Balor's attacks and the fury of the blizzard had left much of her wings burned or frozen. Although she was still capable of flight, her speed had been significantly reduced, and Twilight-Dash knew that was exactly what her opponent had aimed for from the beginning.

Balor relaxed her stance and smirked. She knew the battle was not yet over, and the princess might try to heal herself or unveil a new spell. But in her mind, victory was already assured. All that remained was to execute her final move.

"You seem happy, Balor. Have you already won?" Twilight-Dash asked with a defiant tone.

"Heh heh heh... No, princess of naivety, not yet. But we're very close to putting this unpleasant encounter to an end," Balor replied mockingly before disappearing in a flash of magic.

She had teleported.

"Damn," Twilight-Dash murmured, frustrated. She had invested much of her physical energy trying to take down Balor during the storm, but none of her attacks had been effective enough. Again and again, her opponent had resisted or evaded her assaults with a combination of spells and cunning. Despite this, Twilight-Dash still had an ace up her sleeve: her source of magic remained untouched.

Thanks to the Starheart gem, which blocked the use of spells, her reserve of magical energy was still full. This gave her the confidence to withstand any attack Balor might launch, even if it meant consuming all her magic. She knew she had to wait for the perfect moment to surprise her with a burst of pure power when Balor thought she had already won.

"But even so..."

"Twilight, it's all or nothing. We got this!" exclaimed Rainbow Dash's independent mind enthusiastically.

"Yes, together!" Twilight's independent mind responded determinedly.

[---]

In the distance, atop a barren hill, Balor observed the frozen landscape.

The stage was set.

The water had awakened.
The wind had awakened.
The earth had awakened.

Only the final act remained.

Balor exhaled deeply. A brilliant, almost radiant green light began to manifest around the hooves of the pony she was using as a puppet: Badwhiz Starheart. This earth pony, whom Balor had used as a test subject for her experiments, had taught her much—not only about the history of ponies and the magic they had discovered, but also about the magic that remained hidden from them.

"Garden of Eternity! Haaaa!" Balor exclaimed forcefully, raising her front hooves and striking the ground with determination. While she didn’t actually need such dramatic gestures to cast the spell—concentrating and gathering magic was enough—these theatrics helped reinforce her confidence and set the pace of the battle.

This was the beginning of the end.

Balor felt her inner magical reserves start to drain. It wasn’t a fatal loss, but it was noticeable. This spell was her trump card, an extremely costly resource she had kept secret for years. Neither her masters, nor the great patriarch, nor anyone in Cunabula knew that she had managed to master this magic. Even the other Knights of Order had only a vague idea of the spell Balor was about to unleash to defeat the princess.

A sudden wave of mental fatigue struck Balor, causing her real body to waver slightly. In the oval chamber where her comrades were gathered, the atmosphere filled with concern.

"You don’t need to push yourself so hard. If you need us to transfer some of our strength to you, just say the word," Mannah suggested, watching Balor’s growing exhaustion with concern.

"Silence, Mannah. Keep watch and let me finish this task," the Draco-Dragon responded coldly.

This was the final stretch. This was the plan Balor had imposed on her comrades. Despite the fatigue and exhaustion, she had both the duty and the magic necessary to press forward.

[---]

A cracking sound spread throughout the Great Barrier, and little by little, the signs of an imminent earthquake began to manifest.

Twilight-Dash immediately took to the air. Her wings, though somewhat injured, didn't seem as damaged as she had initially thought. Even so, she remained cautious of her opponent’s next attack.

Was she finally going to face Danu, leader of the Knights of Order? Deep inside, Twilight was no longer sure she had the strength to maintain a conversation, let alone fight him.

The ground began to crack open while the wind blew with increasing force.

As she observed the desolate landscape below, Twilight couldn't help but think that she had never been born to be a warrior...

"Wow, so now it’s that empty-headed ‘leopony’s’ turn. What’s he gonna do now? Try to trap us with a giant rock or something?" Rainbow Dash’s independent thoughts scoffed.

"I don’t think so. He already threw a giant ice block at us a little while ago. It’s very likely his attack will be different this time," Twilight responded.

"Whatever, I just hope this is the last thing they try so we can free our friends."

Twilight remained silent. Analyzing the rhythm of the battle, everything seemed to indicate that this was the final stage of the fight. After this...

The entire ground within the Great Barrier began to shake with violent seismic waves. The layers of ice, previously formed by the blizzard, shattered as if they were fragile cookies being crushed. A new white mist of vapor rose, concealing the ground. This time, however, the mist was lighter and more diffuse, allowing glimpses of the cracks and the collapsing terrain.

Twilight-Dash ascended a bit higher to stay beyond the mist’s reach.

After several minutes of rumbling and shaking, the turmoil finally ceased. Little by little, the mist began to dissipate, revealing a completely transformed landscape.

Twilight-Dash blinked several times, bewildered. She rubbed her eyes and looked down again.

"Well... I wasn't expecting this," she said out loud.

Inside the Great Barrier, where a desolate and devastated wasteland had once stretched, there was now a vast celestial forest covering the entire area. Tall silver trees with sky-blue leaves rose toward the heavens like giant pines covered in a glistening dew. There were no signs of darkness, corruption, or malice. On the contrary, the forest looked healthy, magical, and could even be described as sacred.

Among the trees, circular clearings revealed a lush, green forest floor. At the center of each clearing, large golden flowers shaped like tulips were arranged in what appeared to be a delicate, giant floral pattern.

Twilight-Dash couldn’t hide her bewilderment. This was a "beautiful" forest, but it didn’t give her the impression of being threatening or hiding any danger. She flew around the Great Barrier multiple times, expecting an attack, but nothing happened. After several minutes of searching in vain for Balor, she finally stopped near the remnants of the train, which were still visible.

"I don’t get it. Does she expect us to be dumb enough to go down there and get caught? Or are these flowers some kind of trick?" Twilight-Dash wondered aloud.

Luminous on the ground below her, the golden flowers seemed harmless, but something about their glow and the way they were arranged in perfect circles made them look unnatural. Something didn’t add up in this scene, but Twilight-Dash couldn’t quite pinpoint what it was.

"...I hope they’re not an apology. Because if they are, I won’t accept it," she murmured to herself.

"No, princess. These flowers are to adorn your grave," a voice suddenly replied.

Twilight-Dash immediately turned around. Several meters behind her, Balor watched her with a sinister smile.

"Do you like them?" Balor continued mockingly.

"They’re very beautiful, but they don’t seem appropriate for a funeral," Twilight-Dash replied, instantly raising a magical shield around herself.

Balor, upon seeing the barrier, let out a mocking laugh.

"Really, naïve princess? Even knowing that I possess this powerful amulet, you think using magic is a good idea?" she said with sarcasm.

Twilight-Dash didn’t respond. She remained alert, ready for any hostile move.

"Let me guess. By not using any of your magic during the fight, you were hoping to build up enough power for a counterattack when I was fatigued or showed a weakness," Balor continued, maintaining her mocking tone but showing no offensive intent.

"You’ve kept that shared mental possession going for too long. I know that ability causes great fatigue, and those who overuse it can end up losing their ability to use magic altogether."

"How considerate of you to remind me of the risks! But don’t think for a second that it will change my intentions," Twilight-Dash responded sarcastically.

"If that’s the case, then..." Balor started to say, but her words were suddenly cut off. The magical barrier that Twilight-Dash had raised unexpectedly vanished.

Noticing this, Twilight-Dash quickly backed away and tried to raise the shield again. However, it disappeared once more. She repeated the attempt, but the result was the same. From a distance, Balor stopped smiling and watched her coldly.

A cold sweat ran down Twilight-Dash’s forehead. Balor hadn’t moved closer, and yet, her magic was failing. Slowly, a feeling of heaviness began to take over her body. Her wings, which she had relied on so much, flapped clumsily, struggling to keep her in the air. Panic started creeping in.

"You know, it was quite surprising to learn that in Equestria, there are plants capable of dispelling the mind-controlling magic of my companion Morrigan. In Cunabula, we also have similar plants... Even some that can nullify magic entirely," Balor remarked in a reflective tone.

Twilight-Dash glared at her in anger as she slowly descended. What she had just said could easily be a lie, yet there Balor was, floating effortlessly with magic, contradicting her own words.

"You!" Twilight-Dash tried to shout, but it was already too late. Her wings and the rest of her body lost strength, tilting sideways like a wounded bird. After an erratic flight, her figure began to plummet toward the radiant celestial forest below.

[---]
