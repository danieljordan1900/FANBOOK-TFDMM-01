Rainbow Dash tightened the knot of the rope tied around her waist. At the other end of the rope was Badwhiz, bound and ready to be carried to where her friends were waiting. She had lifted him before, so she was confident it wouldn’t be a problem to transport him this way.

“Perfect! Sorry if I wasn’t gentle enough with you, kid, but I’m in a rush to wrap up this whole charade of your supposed revenge and head to Canterlot with my friends to put on a real show for everyone,” the pegasus said casually, stretching her wings in preparation for takeoff.

On the ground, lying face down, was her enemy, "Vanilla." He had remained motionless ever since the defeat of the Cocatriz Titanicus, leading Rainbow Dash to assume that he had finally accepted his defeat and wouldn’t try anything else.

“Alright, Vanilla—or whoever you are—let’s get moving!” Rainbow Dash declared cheerfully.

“His name is Badwhiz, girl…” an unfamiliar voice interrupted.

Rainbow Dash immediately went on high alert. She spun around quickly, scanning her surroundings with sharp focus. But aside from the tied-up colt, there was no one else. So, that voice had come from…

“…and you’d do well to remember it,” the mysterious voice finished. It was coming from Badwhiz. On the ground, the bound pony lifted his head and locked eyes with Rainbow Dash.

Rainbow Dash froze at the sight of his gaze.

Badwhiz’s eyes were no longer the same. Now, they were so dark they looked hollow, with pupils glowing like will-o’-the-wisps in the night. His sinister expression sent a chill down her spine.

“Wait, what?” Dash exclaimed, confused. But the shock didn’t end there. A dark magic began to envelop Badwhiz’s body, forming sharp black spikes that sliced through his bindings. He soon stood upright, spreading his dark wings as his alicorn armor transformed from jet black to a brilliant light pink.

Badwhiz Starheart was free—but only his physical body.

“I see you don’t recognize me. How pitiful… A poor, wild pony, forced to fight the battles her princess cannot,” the mysterious voice said, with a disconcertingly sympathetic tone. “Let me help free you from this unjust burden.”

A dark spiral erupted from Badwhiz’s body, swirling like a tempest before shooting toward Rainbow Dash.

The pegasus didn’t know what was happening. That voice now coming from "Vanilla" sounded vaguely familiar, but she couldn’t recall where from. The only thing she understood was that the swirling dark magic hurtling toward her was bad news.

With a powerful flap of her wings, Rainbow Dash took off, escaping the mysterious entity that had possessed Badwhiz. Behind her, the vortex faded into the air.

“Please, come down! The burden you’re carrying is too great! You’ll hurt yourself!” the entity called out in distress.

“I don’t know what you’re talking about—Badwhiz?... Ma’am? Who the hay are you?” Dash asked, bewildered. She now understood that "Vanilla’s" real name was Badwhiz, but it was clear that someone else was speaking through him.

“Oh, poor child! It seems it’s too late. Your pride is already consuming you…” the voice lamented.

Rainbow Dash blinked, trying to make sense of those words. That’s when she noticed, with growing horror, dark blotches spreading over her hooves. The pegasus, terrified, shook her hooves in an attempt to rid herself of the marks, but this only made them spread faster across her body.

Panicking, she shot through the sky at full speed, heading for where her friends were waiting. But it was already too late.

“No! No!” Dash screamed, watching as the feathers of her wings fell away, consumed by the relentless darkness creeping over her. She plummeted to the ground, not far from where she had last seen Twilight and the others.

With the last of her strength, she ran toward the silhouettes of her friends. But with each step, she felt parts of her body breaking apart, accompanied by unbearable pain.

“Don’t look back! Don’t look back!” she repeated to herself, crawling forward and fighting against the rising panic. At last, she spotted Twilight’s silhouette in the distance. She was so close. Twilight could—

“Twilight! Twilight!... Twi…light?”

Rainbow Dash froze, stunned. The figures she had seen were not her friends but weathered stone statues. Cold, lifeless, and etched with expressions of pain and despair.

Only Twilight’s figure remained intact, but her gaze reflected profound pity and disappointment.

Rainbow Dash’s tears fell to the ground. Along with them, the last remnants of her consciousness faded into nothingness.

[---]

Morrigan, bearer of the Element of Faith, carefully adjusted the alicorn horn headpiece on the head of the pony she now possessed. The body felt familiar; on previous occasions, she had taken control of Badwhiz with the purpose of perfecting her methods for inflicting pain and suffering on a pony. Despite Balor’s warnings about the potential side effects of overusing her “toy,” Morrigan never cared about the damage she might cause him. In fact, she was convinced that the colt had developed a remarkable resistance to stress and paralysis—something that, to some extent, annoyed her.

“Your servant apologizes, Lady Morrigan. Due to my incompetence, I...” said Badwhiz, whose figure projected itself as a shadowy pony alongside his physical body. This ethereal form of Badwhiz had the same appearance as his physical self but lacked stable consistency.

“It’s not me you should apologize to, boy, but our sub-leader,” Morrigan responded with a haughty, cutting tone.

A dejected Badwhiz lowered his head, unable to reply.

“Humph... it doesn’t matter. Now, we will take an active role in the battle. Do you have anything else to report?” Morrigan asked as she directed her gaze toward Rainbow Dash’s immobilized body.

The pegasus stood rigid, her eyes completely darkened by the magic of mind control. This was the terrifying power of Morrigan, capable of bending the will of even the strongest with a single thought. Her mastery was such that she could even subjugate her fellow knights if she so desired. The only ones capable of resisting her were Balor and Taranis, who had undergone rigorous training to strengthen their minds against such magical arts.

Rainbow Dash, lacking such preparation, had fallen easily under Morrigan’s control the moment she manifested.

“I noticed that pony had a magical crystal in her mane. She might have used it to turn invisible,” Badwhiz reported quickly.

Without hesitation, Morrigan used her mind-control magic to command Rainbow Dash to reveal anything she might be hiding. Moments later, the pegasus dropped all her belongings in front of her.

“Trash…” Morrigan thought, visibly annoyed as she sifted through the pile of items. However, something caught her attention: a sky-blue crystal glowing with a unique light.

That crystal contained magic—magic that felt unmistakably familiar to her.

“Ceridwen needs to see this...” Morrigan thought, taking a few steps forward, completely ignoring Badwhiz’s presence.

Her focus shifted back to the location where her other comrades were gathered.

[---]

In the war chamber of the Knights of Order.

"What’s the matter, Morrigan?" asked Mannah, having sensed that his companion’s thoughts had returned to her physical body. Beside him, the other knights had been observing everything that had occurred on the hilltop through the enchanted pool, which had also split to show what the princess and the other ponies were doing near the train.

"My apologies, Grand Sub-Leader. But I need to confirm a particular discovery with my companion Ceridwen," Morrigan said, paying no attention to Mannah’s harsh glare.

"What is it about?" Ceridwen asked, intrigued.

"Observe this," Morrigan said, raising her left wing. A new division appeared in the pool, revealing a close-up of Badwhiz’s real body on the hilltop. The image focused particularly on the unusual sky-blue pendant he held in his left hoof.

Ceridwen furrowed her brow as she examined the object.

"Tell me, friend, is it what I think it is?" Morrigan asked.

"If you mean it’s a crystal for transmutation of arcane magic, then yes, it is. Why are you showing me this?"

"Can you determine how old it is?"

"Humph." With a suspicious look, Ceridwen extended her enchanted staff toward the glowing crystal’s image in the pool. Much like someone savoring the aroma of hot soup, Ceridwen brought the sample of magic she had drawn closer to her beak.

Though she wasn’t as proficient in magic as Balor, she possessed skills that allowed her to analyze, to some extent, the properties of magical artifacts.

Ceridwen’s eyes widened completely as the crystal’s properties were revealed; she now understood Morrigan’s grave concern.

"How is this possible?" Ceridwen exclaimed in shock.

"There’s no doubt in my mind this is the work of that wretched princess. She must have created it while she was hiding underground. If that’s the case, we have no choice but to ask Balor to reevaluate the plan she’s prepared. In fact, we should request that the entire operation be canceled," Morrigan said darkly, her gaze fixed on her companion, ignoring the others entirely.

"DO YOU REALIZE WHAT YOU’RE SAYING?!" Ceridwen snapped, her earlier shock giving way to anger.

"CAN EITHER OF YOU EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT’S GOING ON?" Mannah bellowed from the other end of the table. Beside him, Taranis made discreet gestures, urging the others to focus on their sub-leader.

Morrigan and Ceridwen, both knights of the Order, glared coldly at each other for a few tense seconds before Ceridwen finally averted her eyes and turned to face the others.

"My apologies for my behavior, Sub-Leader Mannah. But Morrigan’s recent discovery has revealed a significant threat to the continuity of our mission," Ceridwen announced with noticeable concern.

"Explain," Mannah commanded in a frigid tone.

"Ugh..." Ceridwen paused to choose her words carefully. "You see, Sub-Leader Mannah, the crystal Morrigan recently found is a full-spectrum arcane magic transmutation crystal. Based on the purity of its form and the radiation of its magical essence, I conclude that it is very close in quality to our own crystals forged at the Harmony Temple of Cunabula. This, in turn, implies that our enemies possess knowledge of harmony magic manipulation at a level near our own. The capture operation we are currently conducting relies on an artifact that absorbs this very magic, and if employed, it is highly likely that our enemies will present substantial resistance to the magical absorption process, thereby frustrating the success of the operation."

Mannah wasn’t ignorant; he understood basic magical concepts. However, there was something about the arcane technicalities that always left him perplexed. Not wanting to share his doubts with his companions—lest he appear incapable of grasping such important matters—he decided it was most prudent to delegate this task to someone else.

"Companion Taranis, share the same concern as Ceridwen," Mannah stated, expecting a more detailed explanation from his subordinate.

Taranis, standing beside him, replied with a crisp, "Yes," but nothing more. Mannah’s glare grew sharper. After a few awkward seconds of this standoff, the Ophio-Taurus finally realized that his sub-leader expected more than a simple "Yes." Clearing his throat, he waved his staff, drawing everyone’s attention.

"Since the opponent is using the same type of magical tools as we are, we’ve lost the primary advantage we held over them. Proceeding now would mean entering a scenario where the confrontation would be on equal footing, significantly weakening our initial strategy of capturing the pony princess and her allies from a position of superiority," Taranis declared with an ominous tone.

Now, everyone in the room understood the gravity of the situation. Mannah raised one of his tentacles to scratch his temples—a clear sign of his frustration. Once again, the ponies were hindering the plans he had carefully prepared. If they retreated now, how would he explain it to Balor, to whom he had sworn they would capture all the ponies except the princess before she awoke? Worse still, how would Balor react to this setback?

"This is ridiculous..." thought Mannah's bulbous head as he directed his gaze toward the image of Badwhiz on the hilltop. He had assumed—and even demanded—that only the Cocatriz Titanicus and the boy be used to subdue the princess and her allies. But now, the tide had turned against him, and his prior decision had become a mistake.

"Grand Sub-Leader, I believe we should retreat with the captured pony and await the awakening of our companion Balor. Her counsel would be invaluable to..."

"WE WILL NOT DO THAT," Mannah interrupted Ceridwen sharply. "The operation will continue."

"BUT SUB-LEADER, WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION! We could find a better moment after..."

"THIS IS THE BEST MOMENT!" Mannah declared, his tentacles bristling with anger. He rose in his seat, his dominant gaze falling upon everyone in the room, making it clear he would not back down from his decision.

"WE ALL SWORE TO DEFEND CUNABULA AND PRESERVE THE ORDER OF THE HARMONY TEMPLES. WE LEFT OUR HOMES FOR THIS CRUSADE, TRAVELED FAR TO FIGHT THE ENEMY, TASTED DEFEAT, WERE IMPRISONED, BUT WE FREED OURSELVES, AND NOW WE WILL FIGHT AGAIN. WE WILL NOT RETREAT! WE WILL TRIUMPH!" Mannah roared with authority and pride, then gradually calmed himself. "So, I sincerely ask you all... to have a little faith in our mission."

"This isn't faith; it's a gamble," Morrigan muttered under her breath. Mannah immediately shot her a sharp glare.

"Umm... pardon me, Ceridwen, but is that really the case? Did the princess make the crystal? Couldn’t she have obtained it some other way?" Taranis interjected, attempting to ease the rising tension in the room.

"There is a possibility the crystal was made from another one. However, given how little time has passed since its transmutation, there’s no doubt it was crafted shortly after the great barrier was lifted. The only one who could have done it in that timeframe is the detestable princess who wields the Element of Magic. Isn’t that right, companion Ceridwen?" Morrigan replied, answering in her companion’s stead, her firm gaze fixed on Mannah.

"Yes, that’s correct," Ceridwen confirmed, suppressing her bitterness.

It wasn’t surprising that Morrigan had extensive knowledge of such matters. She had many contacts within the Brotherhood of the Temple of Cunabula and had often participated in purification ceremonies, despite being a member of the knights’ order. Her influence was such that she could potentially become the next leader of the Knights of Order if the current leader faltered.

And that was precisely what was happening now.

A tense silence filled the oval-shaped room. Mannah and Morrigan seemed locked in an invisible battle of wills, much like the earlier clash between Ceridwen and Morrigan. However, this time, it was Morrigan who averted her gaze.

"Humph... prolonged discussions like this only benefit our enemies," Morrigan said, turning her attention to the enchanted pool. Then, she faced Mannah again, her tone shifting back to its usual friendliness. "Oh, Grand Sub-Leader, I believe you are the most suitable person to carry out this task. I trust you will accept the great successes that will result from your actions, as well as the unlikely failures."

"I accept," Mannah emphasized, using his water-elemental magic to seize a black crystal from Morrigan’s wings. The large white bird merely shrugged and sat back down, and the rest of her companions followed suit.

"I will proceed with the operation," Mannah announced more calmly. "I hope to have your support, Taranis and Ceridwen."

"Of course, Grand Sub-Leader Mannah," both knights responded. They both noted that Mannah had not addressed them as "companion."

Meanwhile, the seemingly defeated Morrigan lifted her gaze toward the ceiling of the room. There, within a golden orb, Balor was in a deep meditative state, channeling immense amounts of arcane magic into her claws.

"Heh heh heh, I owed you one, little dragon. Mannah will bear the weight of this failed mission for the rest of his days. You might have miscalculated, but it was that idiot who decided to proceed anyway. Heh heh. Now we’re even." she thought to herself.

This was how the Knight of Order, bearer of the Element of Faith, repaid her debt. For Morrigan, forgiveness wasn’t a divine gift but an act of pity that cursed the soul if not repaid swiftly. The forgiveness granted by Balor the previous night was not something she would allow to linger even a single day.

[---]

Once again, Morrigan’s attention returned to the hilltop, where a loyal, shadow-formed Badwhiz awaited her, standing behind his own lifeless, consciousness-free body.

Without turning around, Morrigan began to speak:

"Well, boy, our grand sub-leader will now take over the mental control of this body. Don’t worry about that pegasus. My hold over her will remain even in my absence. Besides, I will share my mental control with you."

As she spoke, a halo of black light briefly illuminated Badwhiz’s shadowy form.

"Please, try to be understanding of our sub-leader’s limited virtues. He’s not as familiar with body possession as I am, nor does he possess my great patience... so, for your own good, make sure that little incident from earlier doesn’t happen again."

"Of course, Lady Morrigan," Badwhiz replied seriously.

"Good. Then farewell, little Danu. Heh heh."

With her mocking farewell, Morrigan’s consciousness left Badwhiz’s real body, immediately replaced by another. Badwhiz didn’t need further clues—he recognized the new presence instantly as the alicorn armor now glowed with a faint blue hue.

The new presence addressed him.

"Lord Mannah, welcome. Your servant awaits your orders," said the shadow pony, Badwhiz, bowing respectfully.

"Excellent. First, forget what that old witch told you. My elemental skills are far superior to hers, and I have far more patience with those who obey me. Is that clear, squire Badwhiz?"

"Perfectly clear, my lord," Badwhiz replied with military precision, though inwardly he harbored doubts about the truth of Mannah’s words.

"Now, listen closely to my instructions..." Mannah said as he turned, his gaze fixed on the horizon where Twilight and her friends were gathered.
