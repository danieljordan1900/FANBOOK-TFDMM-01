At one end of the war room, Balor was shaken by a tremor that ran through her entire body. It was an ominous sensation, forewarning an immense shift in the balance of magic. Balor had been born with the ability to perceive such changes, and throughout her life, there had been very few times when she had felt something similar. Even among those rare moments, she had only experienced a stronger sensation once before—when she had dared to challenge the great patriarch.

Surprised and with her senses on high alert, she quickly turned her gaze toward the rest of her companions, who were watching the enchanted mirror intently.

The expressions on their faces reflected the gravity of the situation. The magical mirror wavered, displaying a location not far from where Ceridwen was. That was one of the marked places where the princess and her companion were expected to have sought refuge.

Minutes earlier, Balor had witnessed the prior confrontation between Ceridwen and Twilight. When it had ended, she had told her comrades that the princess had already reached her limit and that, from that point forward, the battle would be completely under Ceridwen’s control. Confident in this assessment, she had withdrawn to continue analyzing the magical artifacts they had obtained from the ponies.

But now, the situation had changed...

"What does this mean, Balor?" Mannah asked in a grave tone.

Balor took a closer look at the enchanted water mirror, collected a sample, and analyzed the magic reflected within it.

A dark smile spread across her face. This was what she had been waiting for.

"My esteemed sub-leader, Mannah, it is time for you to grant me full control over this operation," she responded with a composed yet determined air.

[---]

A gentle drizzle fell on one end of the Great Barrier, accompanied by a fresh breeze and a barely perceptible mist.

For someone who had dedicated their entire life to the exhaustive study of natural phenomena using strictly the scientific method, this drizzle would have been inexplicable. Considering the limited size of the dome enclosing the surrounding atmosphere, such meteorological events should have been impossible.

However, for Ceridwen, there was a simple explanation: magic.

This dome, also known as the Great Barrier, was the place where Twilight and her friends had been trapped. It was created using a spell very similar to the one protecting the kingdom of Cunabula. Like that one, the Great Barrier generated a beneficial microclimate for those sheltered within it.

But that was where the similarities ended—the subsequent differences were far more notable.

The Great Barrier was considerably smaller than its counterpart, had a more limited duration, lacked environmental restrictions, and did not provide solid security, as it didn’t require immense magical power to break it from the outside or the inside.

Considering all these disadvantages, along with others that arose during the initial planning, one might think that the Great Barrier would fail in its purpose of trapping the princess and her allies. That soon, reinforcements from the outside would arrive and free them effortlessly.

But that would never happen—Ceridwen was as sure of that as she was of the coming dawn.

Balor had added more than one magical barrier to that place; in fact, they were layers upon layers of magic, all tied to the main spell of the Great Barrier. From both the inside and the outside, these layers had been placed to give the Knights of Order all the security needed to ensure that the princess wouldn’t escape or receive reinforcements.

Of course, all this magical overload would cause the barrier to collapse even more quickly, but Balor had overcome this last obstacle with a clever solution.

A time spell.

Using her own lifespan, Balor had extended the duration of the barrier for three days. The cost to Balor would be three years of her youth.

Although channeling such magic was a considerable effort, Balor never hesitated to complete her task. To do so, she had to enter a period of lethargy while casting the spells simultaneously—one of her greatest skills and the one she was most proud of. Protected by her companions, Balor was not interrupted and managed to complete her work successfully.

Ceridwen felt at ease—she had more than a day to find Twilight, but since they were in a battle of great importance for her nation, she definitely would not allow such a waste of time.

Using her magic, Ceridwen hurled a massive rock at an abandoned structure in the distance. The ramshackle building immediately shattered into pieces.

("Only three places left," Ceridwen thought.) She immediately prepared her next projectile. Behind her, Badwhiz continued to cover her, and the crystal cube floated at her side. The next target was an abandoned well; this time, she would use a much larger and sharper rock.

Suddenly, a disturbance in the air interrupted her. Behind her, Badwhiz flinched as he also sensed the unexpected change.

Something had happened.

Letting the rock she had lifted drop, Ceridwen once again took a defensive stance. Behind her, Badwhiz swiftly raised his magical shield to protect her from the possible threat.

Around them, the atmosphere had shifted. The drizzle, like the wind, had stopped, and the mist that had reigned in the area vanished without a trace. One might almost say that nature itself was holding its breath.

Then, an explosion. A beam of light erupted from the place she had just planned to attack. Shooting into the sky in a bright streak, a violet spark ascended high until suddenly stopping against the white sky of the Great Barrier.

Ceridwen's eyes widened as she saw the figure of the pony gazing down at her. It was neither the princess nor her companion. It was an opponent she was unprepared for.

The newcomer slowly began to descend. Ceridwen observed every detail of her new adversary.

The unknown alicorn had a mane similar in style to Twilight’s but with a subtle gradient reminiscent of Rainbow Dash’s. Her entire body, a light shade of violet, seemed wrapped in a soft glow of light radiating from within. Both her horn and her strong wings emitted tiny celestial and lavender-colored particles. She was neither thin nor excessively muscular—her build was perfectly proportioned to her size.

And despite the calm expression on her face, there was an immense power in every beat of her wings. Ceridwen, watching her approach like a moving storm, was certain of that.

Twilight-Dash finally touched the ground with the grace of a princess and the stance of a seasoned warrior. The magical lights that had accompanied her descent faded away. The introductory spectacle was over. Now, Twilight-Dash, appearing as nothing more than an ordinary alicorn, gazed at Ceridwen without hostility or emotion.

Certainly, Ceridwen sensed no hostility, but the tension gripping her only grew.

("Does she want to talk?") she wondered vainly. Ceridwen was surprised by this unexpected turn of events, but she still believed she could control the situation. She didn’t need to be a scholar in magic to understand that she was facing a fusion.

"Let my friends go and return to your home," Twilight-Dash ordered.

Yes, those simple words—far from a threat—were spoken in a voice firm and filled with authority. Or at least, that was the impression she gave. Ceridwen couldn't help but think of her former leader, Danu. Even more, those words reminded her of someone superior to him.

Silence enveloped both adversaries.

Ceridwen snorted slightly and immediately conjured another enchanted golden rod with her magic. She had no words of response for her opponent. After all the tragic events that had taken place in Cunabula the night before, there was simply no longer room for dialogues or negotiations. She would not entertain that anymore.

All that remained was to fight and fulfill her mission.

[---]

"I guess that’s a no," thought Twilight’s independent mind, feeling discouraged by her opponent’s reaction.

"Well, at least you tried. Can we do it the hard way now?" responded Rainbow Dash’s independent mind.

Both minds, separate and independent, shared the same body, cooperating to guide Twilight-Dash’s thoughts and actions. This fusion had its own independent thought process, albeit limited, resulting from the combination of both cognitive patterns. Of course, if a serious conflict arose between Twilight and Rainbow Dash’s decisions, the fusion would stall, and in the worst case, it would come undone.

But at that moment, both friends had no doubts about what they needed to do next.

"So be it," Twilight-Dash replied, breaking the silence.

Ceridwen, who possessed Badwhiz’s body, ignored those last words. Determined to take the initiative in battle, she swiftly prepared two additional rods and aimed them at Twilight-Dash.

However, to Twilight-Dash, those movements felt… too slow. Before, when she had been just Rainbow Dash, she would have praised her opponent’s reflexes. But now, she found them almost disappointing.

In an instant, both thoughts—Twilight’s and Rainbow Dash’s—synchronized with a shared plan of action and launched their counteroffensive.

With a deep breath, Twilight-Dash flapped her wings and surged toward Vanilla with such incredible speed that the world around her seemed to be in slow motion. A smile formed on her face. Her advantage in speed was obvious, but she couldn’t get complacent; what she needed to test now was her endurance.

She continued her unstoppable advance, aiming to break through Vanilla’s magical barrier.

Soon, her front hooves collided with the barrier. The magic bubble, which had protected her enemies from all attacks until then, tore apart as if it were a mere paper covering.

Twilight-Dash grinned even wider; she had barely felt the impact. For a moment, she considered laughing at the ridiculous defense she had just shattered, but she held back—this was no time for boasting.

Keeping her eyes locked on her opponent, Twilight-Dash pressed forward, getting even closer to the one she had previously called Vanilla.

Then, standing right before him, Twilight-Dash frowned; a doubt crept into her mind once more.

Who was this individual? At this point, she wasn’t sure who Vanilla truly was. Nor was she certain of the plan being executed against her. Based on Rainbow Dash’s account and what her friends had told her after getting off the train, she could deduce that this individual had been hiding from the very beginning, using the colt named Badwhiz to put on a show and draw Twilight and her friends’ attention. Once the colt had surveyed the terrain enough and set up a favorable battle scenario, he would manifest through possession for a surprise attack. That would explain the shift in attitude and skills he began displaying later, which had managed to catch Rainbow Dash off guard.

However, that still didn’t explain why Vanilla’s current abilities differed from those Rainbow Dash had initially described. Even his armor had changed. Furthermore, were such extreme precautions necessary just to eliminate them? Given the battles so far, their opponent had had plenty of opportunities to defeat Twilight and her friends. Or was there another motive she hadn’t considered? Could this be a war of attrition designed to gather as much information as possible about the Bearers of the Elements of Harmony while introducing increasingly dangerous threats on the battlefield?

Perhaps they weren’t facing just one enemy but multiple individuals. Probably disciples of the Knights of Order who had been trapped in Tartarus.

The worst possible scenario was that their true enemies were the Knights of Order themselves. Because if that were the case…

"Whoops," Twilight-Dash dodged one of Vanilla’s golden rods. "That was close; I’d better hurry." The projectile had shot out at extreme speed from one of his sides, but to Twilight-Dash’s eyes, it was like watching a very fast sparrow.

Without further delay, Twilight-Dash truly started to move. She dashed around Vanilla’s side, positioning herself behind him. Two more golden rods awaited her there, but she dodged them effortlessly. She extended one of her front hooves and began searching through the back of Vanilla’s mane.

Then she found something solid and pulled it out. It was a tiny crystal cube, nearly identical to the one Vanilla had brought, but with an improved design and a brighter glow.

Twilight-Dash brought it close to her chest and could feel a powerful magic pulsing slowly within it.

Her guess had been correct. Just as she had suspected, Vanilla had hidden the real crystal where her friends were sealed, shrinking it and tucking it behind his mane.

"Sorry I took so long, girls," Twilight-Dash thought to herself, saddened.

A sharp whistle suddenly rang out. Twilight-Dash looked around. The fake sealing crystal cube between Vanilla and Badwhiz began to glow. Vanilla, for his part, had started moving a bit faster and was now slowly aiming his horn at Twilight-Dash. The shadowy Badwhiz, however, seemed completely unaware of what was happening.

"Villains working together… not the first time, but still annoying," Twilight-Dash had had enough of these guys. She spread her wings and flapped them forcefully. Two intense gusts of wind shot out at her enemies. Too slow to react, both Vanilla and Badwhiz were blown away in opposite directions, crashing into the rocks.

And to finish things off, the powerful alicorn delivered a mighty kick to the fake sealing crystal cube, sending it flying somewhere across the Great Barrier.

"Was it really a trap?" Twilight-Dash wondered, puzzled, but she quickly dismissed the thought. There was no time to dwell on that now. Her immediate priority was to take the real sealing crystal cube to a safe place and free her friends. Together, they could activate the Elements’ magic and face Vanilla and his allies. Better yet, she could try fusing them as well.

"How did I not think of that before? Apple Pie? Rari-Flutter-shy?" With this in mind, Twilight-Dash teleported away before her opponents could even process what had just happened.

[---]

"How dare she?" Ceridwen murmured furiously from within Badwhiz's possessed body. Being knocked to the ground by her opponent was one thing, but simply abandoning the battlefield when she had the opportunity to finish her off or capture her was another.

She had been humiliated like this before, and now, once again, the princess was repeating the same pattern.

"That's enough," Ceridwen declared coldly. Then, she summoned a long rosary of black pearls; the amulet ignited with the fire of her magic, ready to be used immediately.

Ceridwen had decided to bring out the heavy weaponry. She had been ordered not to use artifacts of that level, but given the recent turn of the battle, she at least wanted the princess to get a good glimpse of what she was truly capable of.

However, before she could act, a voice interrupted her.

"Ceridwen, my friend, let it go. I will take over the rest of the operation," it was Balor’s voice speaking to her mentally.

"Balor, let me finish!" Ceridwen retorted firmly through the same channel.

"No, we all agreed that at a certain point in the battle, I would have the final say. That moment is now. So please, hand over control of that body immediately," Balor responded in a cold voice, devoid of any sarcasm.

At Balor’s pressing request, Ceridwen calmed down. There was no point in fighting among comrades. They had all agreed to avoid that, and she certainly wouldn’t be the first to break that rule.

"Destroy her, Balor. Restore Cunabula’s honor," Ceridwen pleaded with her companion. It was a sincere request that came from the depths of her heart.

"I intend to, my friend," Balor concluded. At that moment, the communication was cut off, and the two switched places.

[---]

Balor now possessed Badwhiz's real body. His armor had changed from orange to a deep purple. She looked around. The battlefield was a disaster, but she was not the least bit concerned. In fact, she was glad that Ceridwen hadn't gone any further before. Due to Mannah’s initial resistance to her taking leadership of the operation, Ceridwen had been forced to test the strength of the fusion between the pony princess and her companion.

"Politicians..." Balor scoffed internally. After witnessing Twilight-Dash’s overwhelming power, the sub-leader of the Knights of Order had immediately ceded control of the battle.

Not far from where she stood, a shadow rose among the rocks. It was Badwhiz, but he looked pitiful. Even as a mere mass of shadows and magic, his entire form appeared diluted and dull, like soot clinging to fabric.

The disoriented shadow pony turned his head, searching for his companion. He saw Balor and immediately ran toward her. But he stopped a few steps away when he belatedly realized that she was no longer Ceridwen.

Badwhiz bowed as respectfully as he could.

"Lord Balor, the princess escaped with the sealing crystal. We did not have the power to stop her..."

"Indeed. You have expended too much of your limited magic attacking her, and now that you are exhausted, you have become a burden."

"I am sorry..." Badwhiz replied, shrinking back.

"Do not apologize. After all, you are weak."

At his master's words, Badwhiz lowered his head, saddened. Now even his heart felt heavy.

But Balor was not finished.

"Tell me, boy, what do you think is the most decisive factor in a battle?"

Badwhiz, who was exhausted, did not have the strength to think too deeply about an answer to this sudden question, so he could only say the first thing that came to mind.

"Power," Badwhiz answered simply.

"Uhpm," Balor murmured. Then, she lifted a small rock from the ground with her magic and placed it in the palm of her hoof. Turning her back on Badwhiz, she gazed at the horizon of the Great Barrier. Somewhere out there, hidden, was the fusion she needed to defeat.

"Having power is desirable. I do not deny it. However, there is another factor that always ensures the victor's triumph," as she spoke these words, Balor began channeling her magic into the rock she held. "This factor is the key to all wars and the secret to any peace."

A wind blew, stirring the dust around them.

"It is deception," Balor declared. Suddenly, the rock she held shimmered, and in the blink of an eye, it had transformed into the real sealing crystal cube—the very one the Knights of Order had used to trap Twilight’s friends.

[---]

A little earlier, inside a rabbit burrow, Twilight-Dash was analyzing the sealing crystal cube.

"Twilight, seriously, can’t we just crack it open like a nut with our hooves?"

"This is a very delicate object, Rainbow Dash. If we make the slightest mistake, it could explode with all our friends inside or trap us as well."

"Really?" insinuated Rainbow Dash’s independent mind smugly.

"Well... not really, but there are probabilities. Maybe a hexagonal revelation spell will give me some clues. Uhpm. No, better yet, a six-phase arcane analysis should be enough..." Twilight’s independent mind continued thinking aloud about other options to begin deciphering the cube.

"Arggg!" Rainbow Dash groaned. The pegasus was already starting to regret not finishing the previous battle. If she had, she would have enjoyed taking down the villains and spared herself from continuing the fusion with Twilight. Then she wouldn’t be stuck listening to all the nerdy and incomprehensible suggestions running through her friend’s mind.

Several minutes had already passed in this task, and for Rainbow Dash, the situation was becoming unbearable.

Then, unexpectedly, it happened.

"Eh?" Twilight-Dash exclaimed the moment the sealing crystal cube flashed and transformed into its fake version. "What the hay?"

Just like before, this fake crystal continued whistling, like a kettle coming to a boil, or rather, like a bomb about to explode.

[---]

A violent eruption exploded from one of the hills within the great barrier. In the distance, Balor observed the result of the conflagration. Just as she had calculated, the explosion had not destroyed the fusion of the princess and her ally. The one who had emerged from the column of dust from the explosion was unharmed.

"Predictable..." Balor murmured to herself. Then she glanced back.

There was Badwhiz, who had an expression as if he were expecting her to say something more.

"What a child..." Balor thought. She had a good opportunity to give Badwhiz a lecture at that moment, but she didn’t.

Balor was not that kind of person. Her master, on the other hand, would have done so. He was someone exemplary who never missed the chance to teach his ideals to others. He was a person Balor admired, even though she never managed to earn his approval.

Even now, she could vividly recall the sermons he used to give her for her faults.

"...we, the Knights of Order, defend our nation with truth. Not with lies. It is unworthy for us to resort to deceitful arts or vague rhetoric. Remember that by using the same weapon, the knight takes it as an extension of themselves. If this weapon turns out to be lies, the knight will lose their purpose and become just another criminal in the eyes of justice. Punishment will not delay in reaching them..."

These had been the wise words she received from her master. She had not been a good student; it was quite obvious she wouldn’t be a good teacher either.

She really didn’t feel capable of properly teaching Badwhiz.

"Don’t make that face, boy. This is no time for lessons."

"Eh? Excuse me... I’ll keep your words in mind, Lord Balor," said Badwhiz, somewhat confused, bowing his head.

"Keep them in mind, kid, but don’t take them too much to heart. It’s just common sense, and in practice, lies don’t always work. Besides, peace can also arise in other ways. Like from true sacrifices..." Balor murmured, gazing somewhere up in the sky.

Badwhiz found his teacher’s behavior strange, but he said nothing more.

"Alright, that’s enough. Now I will dissipate your consciousness and complete the mind domination spell." As she finished speaking, the shadowy figure that made up Badwhiz began to dissolve like smoke in the wind. Meanwhile, the consciousness of the pink-maned pony began to drift into some nebulous and drowsy place.

Badwhiz’s last thought at that moment was of his pet, Beak. He still hoped that it was safe.
