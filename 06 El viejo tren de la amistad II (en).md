In the train bound for Canterlot, within one of the cargo carriages stacked high with crates and bulky luggage, a young pony sat cloaked in oppressive darkness. His face, faintly illuminated by the dim light seeping through the hatch above, betrayed a nervous energy. He hadn’t slept the previous night, and it had been hours since he’d had anything to eat. Yet none of this was the true source of his unease. His spirit remained resilient, his mind sharp and alert.

It was, rather, his clarity—the unyielding awareness of his predicament—that fed the storm inside him.

The moment of his ultimate trial was drawing near.

Trying to steady his nerves, he reached for the bottle of cider his mentors had gifted him before he boarded the train. It was his first time tasting cider, and the fiery burn of the first sip made him cough dryly, the sound echoing in the stillness of the carriage. Despite the discomfort, he kept drinking, downing about a third of the bottle before setting it aside. Gradually, the warmth of the drink eased the trembling in his hooves, and his thoughts became more focused.

With a bit of time to spare, he switched on the music player he carried, slipped on the headphones, and let himself sink to the floor in an attempt to relax.

The headphones were so new that their box still rested nearby, untouched apart from the broken seal. Another gift he hadn’t asked for but couldn’t refuse. It was unlikely he’d ever get the chance to own something this sophisticated again in his lifetime.

Curious about the sleek gadget, he picked up the box and read the label softly: "Gamma Silente Headphones - Averages C."

[---]

"...and that's what happened," Rainbow Dash concluded confidently. In front of her, her friends listened intently.

"Wow! That was incredible! You fought a giant crocodile, saved Daring Do from being eaten by a swarm of ant-locusts, and restored peace to a kingdom of hippos. You're amazing, Dashie!" Pinkie Pie exclaimed, bouncing excitedly in her seat.

"Yeah, that's a pretty ‘incredible’ story, Rainbow," Applejack remarked, her tone dripping with skepticism as she cast a sidelong glance at Rarity.

"And after all that, Daring Do gave you the original draft of her latest book? My goodness..." Fluttershy murmured thoughtfully, her hooves fiddling with the saddlebag slung across her side.

"Exactly! That's exactly how it happened," Dash confirmed, radiating an almost defiant confidence.

The four ponies turned their attention to the pile of disheveled and battered documents Rainbow Dash had proudly placed on one of the seats moments earlier.

"We understand these documents are very valuable, darling. And since you've brought them to our little gathering today, I suppose this must be the big surprise you have planned for Twilight, right?" Rarity asked, narrowing her eyes.

"Of course!" Dash exclaimed with excitement. "Knowing her, she's probably read the published book ten times already. But I’m sure she’ll be blown away when she sees this."

Rainbow Dash had pictured this moment over and over. Her friends would bombard her with questions and praise for her brilliant idea, and she'd respond to each one enthusiastically. As long as she avoided mentioning that other dangerous matter, everything she’d gone through to get those documents would be worth it.

All I need is their approval... just that.

Keeping her emotions tightly guarded, Dash waited with a confident smile. But...

Nothing of the sort happened.

Instead, her friends exchanged silent glances, their expressions laced with concern.

"What’s wrong?" Dash asked, a chill of unease creeping over her as she noticed the lack of enthusiasm. "Don’t you think she’ll be impressed?"

She didn’t show it on her face, but inside, a growing fear was twisting her stomach into knots.

"Oh, she’ll definitely be surprised," Applejack replied in a calm yet firm tone. "It’s just that your story doesn’t explain what happened earlier."

A faint twitch in Dash's eyelid betrayed her nerves, though she didn’t seem to notice it herself.

"Explain what?" she shot back immediately, feigning innocence.

"Who was that suspicious pony we saw earlier?" Applejack asked seriously, her gaze unwavering.

"Oh, that? It’s nothing important," Dash replied with a casual shrug and a forced laugh. "Just a fan I met somewhere. She wants me to sign a contract to be her star model. Funny, right?"

Her words, deliberately simple, hardly convinced anyone. Applejack frowned, and Rarity raised a skeptical eyebrow.

"A fan?" Applejack pressed, her tone sharpening.

"You should probably talk to her. She shouldn’t be creeping on you like that. It'll just cause you more trouble and make you more stressed than you already are," Pinkie chimed in, pulling a muffin out of nowhere and taking a nonchalant bite.

The other ponies shot her brief, reproachful looks; they all knew Pinkie wasn’t exactly the best source of advice on boundaries, given her own history of similar behavior.

"Stressed? What are you talking about, Pinkie? I'm perfectly fine," Dash retorted, her tone a mix of exasperation and defiance.

"Pinkie’s right, darling. You look dreadful. Have you seen yourself in a mirror?" Rarity chimed in, her usual dramatic concern for appearances shining through.

Rainbow frowned, feeling a twinge of irritation. She rarely trusted Rarity’s opinions on her looks, considering them overly melodramatic. Still, the seed of doubt was planted, so she turned to the friend she knew would never lie to her.

"Fluttershy, do I really look that bad?" she asked, avoiding Applejack's piercing gaze.

"Well... you don’t look too bad, but when you first arrived, I was really worried. Actually, we all were," Fluttershy admitted softly as she pulled out a small mirror and offered it to Dash.

With some reluctance, Rainbow glanced at her reflection. Fluttershy wasn’t wrong. Her mane was more disheveled than usual, her eyes were slightly red, and faint dark circles lingered beneath them. She still thought she looked awesome—naturally—but she couldn’t deny she wasn’t at her best.

"Maybe you should go talk to your 'admirer' and clear things up," Applejack cut in firmly. "We’ve got a special day planned with Twilight, and it wouldn’t be fair to mess it up with all this drama."

Dash rolled her eyes with a groan, letting out an exaggerated sigh. "Pfft! You worry too much, Applejack! Everything’s fine!"

Just then, the cheerful chime of the train car bell interrupted the conversation. Moments later, a train attendant poked his head in, the lively chatter of young voices growing louder beyond the door.

"Excuse me, is Miss Rainbow Dash here? A group of foals is eager to meet her," the attendant announced kindly. The noise outside surged, accompanied by excited shouts and praises directed at the pegasus.

Rainbow Dash’s friends turned toward the commotion, but when they looked back to Dash... the spot where she had been standing was empty.

"Rainbow?" Applejack called, blinking as she scanned the car.

A few steps away, Dash’s silhouette was visible. Her head was sticking out of the window, and the rest of her body was poised in a suspiciously ready-to-jump stance.

"Ha, ha! Sure is warm today, huh?" Dash said with a nervous grin, slowly retreating back into the center of the car while doing her best to avoid her friends’ questioning stares.

[---]

The train car erupted into a deafening uproar of cheers and excited shouts.

"IT'S RAINBOW DASH!" "SHE'S AMAZING!" "YEAH!" cried the foals, practically vibrating with joy as they crowded around their idol. Her friends watched with amused smiles—except Applejack, who maintained a skeptical expression.

"Alright, I’ve got this," Dash said, visibly perking up. She stepped away from her friends and strode forward confidently. "Wow! I guess you all came here for an autograph, huh?"

"YEEEEESSS!" the young ponies neighed in unison, some bouncing up and down while others stomped their hooves in a frenzy of excitement.

The roar of cheers and the glimmering admiration in her fans’ eyes rekindled Rainbow Dash’s energy. With a flourish of her wings, she lifted into the air, striking her signature pose. Any trace of fatigue or unease melted away, as though the adoration itself had magically reinvigorated her.

"Alright, alright, calm down. Form a line and give me something to sign." Dash landed next to a seat and, as if she had rehearsed it, pulled a pen out from her mane. "Okay, who’s first?"

Without hesitation, the foals lined up in an orderly queue. First up was a filly sporting a pink hat and ribbon, holding what appeared to be a cookbook. Beaming, she handed it to Dash.

"Huh? Are you sure you want me to sign this? Fine by me." Dash quickly scribbled her name across the open page.

"YESSS! Of course! Your Blackberry Pie recipe tastes just like my grandma’s!" squealed the filly before bouncing out of the line.

"Uh... what?" Dash muttered, confused. Behind her, she could hear Pinkie Pie choking on a muffin, but decided to ignore it. "Alright… next!"

"Me! Me! Over here!" a blue-coated colt with white sneakers called, handing Dash a travel shoe catalog.

"Now this is more like it! Here you go." Dash swiftly signed the booklet.

"Awesome! Now my parents have to buy me the same sneakers you wear! Yesss!" the colt shouted, running off excitedly.

Behind Dash, her friends exchanged murmurs. She didn’t turn around, but her smile began to falter as an uncomfortable feeling crept over her. Something wasn’t adding up.

Everypony in that car knew perfectly well that Rainbow Dash didn’t wear sneakers.

"Okay, you!" she said, pointing a hoof at the next filly—a young pony with stickers plastered across her face. "Where do you want me to sign?"

"On my fashion magazine," the filly answered brightly.

"And that’s because…?" Dash asked, feeling a knot tighten in her stomach.

"Because I love your makeup! Your sparkles and stickers are fabulous! Yip!" the filly neighed enthusiastically.

Rainbow Dash nearly yanked the magazine from the filly's hooves. Flipping through it, her expression shifted to one of mild horror.

"Alright, here’s your autograph," she said briskly, scrawling her name and handing the magazine back. She then turned to the remaining line.

"THANK YOU FOR COMING, BUT THAT’S ALL FOR NOW!" she suddenly shouted.

A ripple of confusion swept through the foals, but before they could voice their disappointment, Dash raised a hoof and added:

"I’LL KEEP SIGNING AUTOGRAPHS WHEN WE GET TO THE NEXT STATION! I PROMISE! RAINBOW DASH’S WORD!"

Perhaps it was blind faith in her or simple politeness, but most of the foals complied, though a few visibly pouted. With the help of the train attendant, Rainbow Dash quickly ushered the young ponies out of the car.

Dash let out an exhausted sigh as she shut the door of the train car behind the last of the foals. One problem had been resolved, but now she felt a bigger one looming over her.

"Wow, Rainbow, I didn’t know you liked wearing sneakers," Pinkie Pie remarked, holding up a brochure one of the foals had dropped.

Before another second passed, Dash sprang into action with lightning speed. She snatched the brochure from Pinkie’s hooves and hastily scooped up all the others scattered on the floor, tossing them out one of the train’s windows.

“Whew! Those kids really need to take better care of where they leave their trash. Cleanliness is super important, don’t you think?” Dash said, breathless, as she slammed the window shut with a forced grin.

Her friends stared at her in baffled silence. While most exchanged uneasy glances, trying to brush off the incident, Applejack wasn’t about to let it go.

“That’s it! Rainbow Dash, what in tarnation are you hiding?” demanded the farm pony, her tone firm as she stepped closer to the pegasus.

“Hiding? Me? Hah! What could I possibly be hiding?” Dash replied, letting out a laugh that sounded more like a nervous hiccup.

“Ever since you got here, somethin’ just ain’t sittin’ right. And when somethin’ ain’t right, I can’t just keep my mouth shut. So I’m askin’ you one more time—WHAT ARE YOU HIDIN’, RAINBOW DASH?” Applejack’s voice rose as her emerald eyes bore into Dash’s.

“Whoa, whoa, calm down, Applejack! Everything’s fine. Nothing to worry about. Right, girls?” Dash’s eyes darted to her other friends, silently pleading for backup.

But all she got was silence.

The weight of her friends’ disapproving gazes bore down on her. Frustration bubbling up, Dash decided she’d had enough. Her tone turned sharp and defensive as she spoke:

“Y’know what? I just remembered I have something to pick up. I’m gonna head on ahead. See you all in Canterlot.”

“You—!” Applejack started, her voice tinged with indignation, but she was cut off by an unexpected voice.

“Leaving already, Rainbow Dash? I thought you’d want to spend more time with your friends,” a smooth, unfamiliar voice chimed in from the far end of the car.

Everypony turned to look. There, lounging comfortably and holding a drink in her hoof, sat none other than Magazine Doublereport herself.

[---]

The train's progress had slowed to a crawl. Out in the vast prairie, flocks of sheep leisurely crossed the tracks, oblivious to the frustration of the train engineers, whose schedule was already severely behind.

Meanwhile, the guest carriage was a hub of far more activity. A mysterious pegasus with a white coat and a red mane streaked with black had suddenly interrupted the gathering of friends. Rising to her hooves, the unfamiliar mare approached the ponies with a sly look and a radiant smile. Her confident demeanor was that of a seasoned city entrepreneur. And indeed, that’s precisely what she was. The yellow tie she wore, the office accessories peeking from her sleek saddlebags, and the overpowering fragrance she exuded made that abundantly clear.

Magazine Doublereport didn’t need an introduction; her presence spoke for itself—especially the corporate badge pinned to her chest, bearing a sophisticated "A" in red, black, and white.

Of course, as a businesspony, she had to introduce herself anyway. But far from finding it tedious, she relished these theatrics.

And in this moment, Magi—as she preferred to be called—was enjoying herself even more as she noticed the faint flicker of fear in Rainbow Dash’s eyes.

“Hello! So wonderful to meet you all! I’m Magazine Doublereport, owner and CEO of the Averages Consortium. Please, call me Magi. It’s an honor to meet the heroic and celebrated friends of Princess Twilight Sparkle,” Magi said in an enthusiastic burst that was almost a whinny.

One by one, Magi greeted Rarity, Pinkie Pie, and Fluttershy, handing out promotional brochures with a dazzling smile.

“Uh, you’re not the pony from a moment ago…” Applejack observed skeptically, her eyes narrowing.

“And you must be Applejack! So pleased to meet you!” Magi replied, grabbing Applejack’s right hoof and shaking it so vigorously that the farm pony stumbled to the side, visibly dizzy.

With the introductions complete, Magi addressed the group with her trademark confidence.

“Apologies for the interruption, but I need to borrow your friend Rainbow Dash for just a moment,” she announced, stepping closer to the pegasus. “Your friends are as amazing as you said they’d be, Dash. You really should’ve warned me you’d be meeting them—naughty, naughty! But no hard feelings. More importantly, I need you to sign some documents to include the Crystal Empire in the marketing campaign. The Dash Splash cleaning accessories are a hit! Great name, don’t you think? Dash…? Dash?”

Rainbow Dash didn’t respond. Her eyes were glued to the brochures her friends were holding.

Pinkie Pie was barely stifling a laugh as she stared at a pajama catalog featuring Rainbow Dash in bunny ears. Rarity, stunned, examined a fashion flyer where Dash modeled an elegant spring ensemble. Fluttershy, frozen—no, paralyzed—clutched a brochure for “friendly hunting,” complete with images of taxidermied animals.

Without warning, Rainbow Dash bolted straight out the nearest window, leaving her stunned friends behind.

“Great. There she goes again. Is she always like this?” Magi asked, her tone a mix of irritation and surprise.

“And who exactly did you say you were?” Applejack demanded, still trying to steady herself after the overly zealous handshake.

“Pardon me, Miss Magi,” Rarity interjected politely, stepping forward. “But what exactly is your connection to our friend Rainbow Dash?”

“I’m her legal representative and manager,” Magi replied nonchalantly, settling into a nearby seat.

“Rainbow Dash has a manager?” Pinkie asked, tilting her head in visible confusion.

The rest exchanged glances, equally bewildered by this unexpected revelation.

"I believe I've heard of the Averages Consortium before..." murmured Rarity thoughtfully. After a brief pause, she added with a more serious tone, "Miss Magi, this is truly surprising for all of us. Could you please explain a bit more about this situation?"

"Of course, Miss Rarity. You see, your friend Rainbow Dash recently signed a binding contract with the Averages Consortium, allowing us to use her name and likeness. Given her immense significance as a star client, I personally took on the responsibility of managing all legal matters related to her. It's a challenge, considering how 'hectic' her daily schedule tends to be. Still, she's a crucial investment in our vision to make her the newest and greatest celebrity in all of Equestria!" Magi explained with a triumphant smile, as if announcing the crowning achievement of her career.

When she finished, Rarity was utterly stunned, as were most of her friends.

Well, not all of them.

Applejack, who had maintained a neutral expression throughout the conversation, had already suspected what kind of news Magi might deliver. The phrase binding contract only confirmed her suspicions. She wasn’t an expert in legal matters like Twilight, but her granny had shared enough tales about such documents to know they rarely brought good news.

"So that's what she did..." Applejack murmured, piecing things together in her mind. Then, with a firm tone, she added, "So that's why you've been chasing after our friend, huh, Miss 'Magi'?"

Sensing the tension in Applejack's voice and anticipating where this was heading, Magi replied swiftly.

"I’d like to avoid any misunderstandings between us. Miss Rainbow Dash was given a fair deal and was fully informed of the terms of the document she signed with my organization. As such, I’m simply ensuring she fulfills her obligations under that agreement."

"Fulfills her obligations? And what does that mean, exactly?" Applejack shot back, her gaze unwavering.

Magi let out an almost imperceptible sigh. "Well, it's an unfortunately long explanation. I doubt you and your friends have the time—"

"We’ve got the time!" Applejack interrupted with firm determination. Her friends immediately nodded in agreement, making it clear they were ready to hear whatever Magi had to say.

Magi, however, wasn’t nearly as enthusiastic.

"Very well," Magi conceded with a slight bow of her head. Internally, she sighed again, resigning herself to delivering an explanation she would rather avoid. But she knew that to maintain control of the situation and steer it toward her objectives, she had no choice.

Without further ado, Magi began to explain. She detailed how, after meeting Rainbow Dash and convincing her to sign a binding contract at the Averages Consortium’s headquarters in Manehattan a few days prior, she and her team had started using Rainbow's likeness in advertising campaigns. She pointed out that while the brochures featured ponies who looked like Rainbow Dash, they weren’t actually her—just models meticulously styled to replicate her colors. Magi emphasized that Rainbow Dash had personally approved these strategies during a meeting, making it clear that everything had been handled professionally.

However, Magi left out a critical part of the story.

The truth was that all of it had been achieved through carefully crafted lies and manipulative tactics to secure Rainbow Dash's consent.

In reality, Magi wasn’t the virtuous pony her polished exterior suggested. Her business methods revolved around half-truths, subtle threats, and calculated deceit. And she executed it all with a radiant smile—a smile that wasn’t fake. Magi genuinely enjoyed the dark satisfaction of having power over others.

And if all else failed, Magi could always rely on more... persuasive methods.

As Magi finished her explanation, an unsettling sense of doubt lingered in the air between the friends.

"But why would Rainbow Dash want to become a commercial celebrity? She doesn’t chase that kind of fame," Fluttershy asked, her voice filled with genuine concern for her friend.

"It’s true that, at first, your friend Rainbow Dash showed no interest in my proposal," Magi replied calmly, taking a sip of her drink. "However, she changed her mind when I included an opportunity to acquire the original drafts of the latest Daring Do book in my offer. She seemed quite thrilled to get them. I believe she mentioned something about ‘winning a very special competition.’ Though, I’m not entirely sure what she meant by that..."

The four friends exchanged glances, then turned their attention to the pile of documents on one of the seats. Slowly, the pieces began to fall into place. Three years ago, the five of them had made a promise to surprise or celebrate Twilight on a day like this. They hadn’t specified what kind of celebration it would be—whether a party, a gift, or a thoughtful gesture—but they had made it clear that it would be a collaborative effort, without competition. Now, the recent events hinted that Rainbow Dash had decided to break that rule.

"This is truly shocking, Miss Magi. We’d like to know more about this delicate matter, if you don’t mind sparing us a little more of your time," Rarity declared, already sensing the depth of the trouble Rainbow Dash had gotten herself into.

"I don’t mind at all, Miss Rarity," Magi replied swiftly, her tone colder than before. "However, I don’t have much time to provide further explanations. I have a meeting with the board of directors at the Averages Consortium later today, and my star client, Rainbow Dash, must be present. I am obligated to bring her to our Manehattan offices, or your 'friend' could face severe legal consequences. I don’t want that to happen, and I imagine neither do you. So, if you’ll excuse me—"

"Don’t worry about that. I’ll go find her," Applejack interrupted abruptly.

"You know where she is?" Rarity asked in surprise, joined by Pinkie Pie’s exclamation of curiosity.

Applejack nodded firmly. Her confidence was enough to silence further questions from her friends. Magi, observing the gesture, narrowed her eyes slightly.

"Can you really bring her back?" Magi inquired, her tone skeptical.

"Sure can, and I don’t need you tagging along," Applejack stated plainly, leaving no room for negotiation.

Magi weighed the suggestion as she took another sip of her drink. Finally, she made her decision.

"Very well. I’ll trust you, Miss Applejack, and I’d appreciate it if you could bring her back. I’ll wait here... but no more than 20 minutes," Magi said, reluctantly agreeing, though her tone carried a hint of doubt.

"Won’t take that long. Be right back," Applejack assured her, adjusting her hat before quickly heading out through the back door of the carriage.

Her friends watched her leave, their concern evident. Each of them silently wondered what was going on with Rainbow Dash and fervently hoped Applejack would succeed in bringing her back.

Meanwhile, Magi...

"I have samples of the new Jumy Ginger Cookies. Anyone interested?" she offered with an air of casual indifference.

"Oooh, me!" Pinkie Pie exclaimed, enthusiastically raising her right hoof.

[---]

On the delayed train heading from Ponyville to Canterlot, Applejack trotted toward the last car. When she arrived, she found it locked, which didn’t surprise her—it was a special cargo car. However, something caught her attention: it was heavily secured, with sealed windows and reinforced doors. Despite her curiosity, she decided not to dwell on it. She had a more important task at hoof. Resolute, she climbed a ladder to the roof of the car, searching for her friend.

Soon enough, she spotted the silhouette she was looking for. Rainbow Dash sat at the far edge of the car’s roof, her figure outlined against the horizon. Her rainbow mane looked dull, and her wings hung limply at her sides. She was utterly still, her gaze lost in some distant point along the tracks the train left behind.

Without saying a word, Applejack walked over and sat beside her. Rainbow Dash didn’t react.

“So… you came,” Rainbow finally said, snapping out of her thoughts and glancing at her friend.

“Yup,” Applejack replied calmly.

“How’d you know I’d be here?”

“Had a hunch. Didn’t think you’d actually leave us behind, so I figured you’d be somewhere on the train where you’d feel the most at ease… you like watching things in motion, don’t ya?”

Rainbow let out a weak sigh, turning her eyes back to the train tracks. “Yeah, I do. I like watching things in motion.”

The two friends sat quietly, watching the scenery unfold before them: a serene green plain bathed in the light of the midday sun, its tranquility broken only by the disordered passage of grazing sheep.

After a while, Applejack broke the silence.

“Magi told us part of what happened, but I don’t think she’s being entirely honest. I want to hear it from you.”

“Of course…” Rainbow muttered, not looking at her.

Applejack waited, but Rainbow stayed silent. As the pause dragged on, Applejack pressed her.

“Well? You gonna tell me what happened?”

“It’s not your problem,” came the curt reply.

“Rainbow…”

“I’m serious. It’s not your problem. Or theirs. I just… I did something really stupid.”

“And that’s why you don’t wanna talk about it? You plan to fix it all on your own?”

“Exactly.”

Applejack sighed, almost rolling her eyes. Without warning, she stood up, raised a hoof, and gave Rainbow Dash a firm but measured bop on the head.

“OW! HEY!” Rainbow shouted, turning to her, startled and indignant at the sudden hit.

Standing there, as expected, was Applejack. A solid earth pony she’d competed against countless times, someone who’d shared all kinds of adventures with her. That same pony, so familiar in her life, was now giving her a stern, no-nonsense glare—the kind only an Apple family pony could muster. Yet, more than the glare of an angry farm pony, this was the glare of a true friend.

“Tell me, Rainbow, when did my BRAVE BEST FRIEND turn into a YELLOW-BELLIED CHICKEN?”

Rainbow Dash’s eyes lit up with anger at those words, and a faint spark brought some life back to her dimmed mane. Applejack noticed the change and, though she felt a glimmer of relief, held her ground. She knew that if she wanted to bring back the real Rainbow Dash, she’d have to tread as carefully as a cat in boots on a glass rooftop.

"I'M NOT A CHICKEN, AND THIS IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS!" Rainbow Dash snapped, her voice sharp and cutting.

"IS IT REALLY SO IMPORTANT THAT YOU'D PUT OUR FRIENDSHIP ASIDE?" Applejack retorted firmly.

Rainbow Dash didn’t reply, her silence speaking louder than any words. Applejack exhaled deeply, disappointment evident in her expression. She turned and began to walk away.

Rainbow hesitated, torn between her pride and her guilt. But as she saw Applejack leaving, she sprang into the air and flew after her.

"HEY, HEY, WAIT! I'm not putting our friendship aside, I just… I don’t want you all getting involved," Rainbow explained hurriedly as she caught up to Applejack.

"IT'S THE SAME THING," Applejack shot back, turning to face her.

"YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!"

"THEN MAKE ME UNDERSTAND… please," Applejack urged, her tone softening.

Rainbow Dash lowered her gaze, visibly struggling with herself. Finally, she sighed and confessed, "It’s just… I’m really embarrassed."

Applejack frowned, puzzled. "That’s it?"

"It’s not 'just that,'" Rainbow retorted, frustration lacing her voice.

"How bad could it be?"

"Really bad." Rainbow went quiet for a moment, then, as if forcing the words out, she continued, "After I signed that stupid contract, they called me back. That’s when I found out they’d been using my image for cooking promotions…"

Applejack raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "That doesn’t sound so bad, Rainbow. Magi told us—"

"They also did beauty promotions," Rainbow interrupted, sweat beginning to bead on her forehead.

"Okay, but—"

"And they’re selling special Hearts and Hooves Day outfits for mares with me as the model!" Rainbow finally blurted, covering her face with her wings as a deep blush spread across her cheeks.

Applejack stared in silence. After a moment, she cautiously asked, "Is there more?"

"Yes… a lot more," Dash admitted, a mix of shame and fear in her voice.

Silence settled between them again, broken only by the rhythmic clatter of the train rolling along the tracks. Applejack closed her eyes, thinking over what her friend had just revealed. She also recalled how Rainbow Dash had reacted in the past to similarly embarrassing situations, like the time unfounded rumors in a school paper had nearly destroyed her public image. But unlike that incident, this wasn’t some external prank—it was the result of Rainbow’s own poor decisions.

Knowing how much pride Rainbow carried, Applejack could only imagine the enormous weight of shame pressing down on her friend, crushing her from within.

Applejack sighed and broke the silence.

"Seems like this time, you've really gotten yourself stuck up to your neck in the mud. How many ponies get Magi’s magazines, anyway?"

"According to what she told me, by the end of next week, everypony in Equestria will have a copy. By then, my public image will be ruined," Dash muttered, still avoiding eye contact.

"And what’s your plan for fixing it?"

"I’ll figure something out… like always!" Dash declared with a confident grin, though the way her eyes darted away betrayed her uncertainty.

The train continued its slow journey across the prairie. From their perch on the car’s roof, Applejack and Rainbow Dash could see herds of sheep grazing peacefully in the distance. Some groups wandered lazily across the path the train left behind, oblivious to the world around them. The sheep carried on with their routines, unaffected by it all.

The silence returned, settling heavily between the two friends. It wasn’t uncomfortable, but it was tangible, until Applejack, unable to hold back, broke it once more.

“All this… for a book?”

“Yes…” Dash admitted with a sigh. “It’s so dumb now that I think about it. I could’ve done something simple, like a vacation trip or some friendly competition between us. But NO! I had to go big, had to do something unique, something amazing—‘SOMETHING INCREDIBLE!’” she exclaimed, throwing her front hooves dramatically into the air before letting herself flop back against the roof of the train car. “I guess, deep down, I just wanted to outdo what you did.”

“Rainbow, we promised we wouldn’t compete with each other—not for this,” Applejack reminded her firmly but warmly.

“YEAH, I KNOW! … I know,” Dash sighed again, her ears drooping as her gaze wandered to the passing landscape.

“The others need to hear it from you,” Applejack said gently.

“They do, but… their faces. I can’t take it, AJ. I…”

“I’ll be there. They won’t laugh,” Applejack assured her, resting a comforting hoof on Rainbow’s shoulder.

Rainbow Dash looked up at her, touched. For a moment, her expression softened, like a foal receiving forgiveness from her mother: warm and full of gratitude. But before Applejack could say more, Dash shook her mane, wiped her face with her wings, and straightened her posture.

Her trademark confidence returned, and Applejack recognized it instantly. A wave of relief washed over her, though she managed to suppress the urge to cheer out loud.

The real Rainbow Dash was back. Her emotional recovery had been quicker than Applejack had dared to hope.

“All right, Applejack. You win. I’ll tell them everything. But after that, I’ve got to meet up with Magi. She has some meeting… or whatever. I need to be there. Hopefully, it won’t take long… I think,” Dash declared, her eyes sparkling with renewed determination.

Applejack hadn’t expected that response. She briefly glanced toward the horizon, carefully considering her next words.

“If that’s really what you want, we’ll support it,” she finally said, hiding part of her face beneath the brim of her hat.

“Umph, thanks…” Dash frowned slightly, sensing something off about the ever-honest Applejack’s words, but decided to let it slide. “Okay, let’s get back already.”

With the agility they both shared, Rainbow Dash and Applejack climbed down from the roof of the train car and re-entered the train.

After a short walk, they reached their destination.

Inside, they found Magi and the rest of their friends. Following a brief round of greetings and some small talk, Rainbow Dash took a deep breath. Then, steeling herself against her fears, she began her confession.

While she omitted certain details about her stay at the Tower of Averages, she was honest about how she’d been treated and the circumstances that led her to sign the binding contract with Magi. She recounted her return to Average’s offices, her desperate attempts to avoid Magi, and the internal struggle that had culminated in that very moment on the train.

Throughout her explanation, Applejack remained by her side, and none of their friends interrupted—not even Pinkie Pie, who only made exaggerated faces but stopped each time she felt Applejack’s piercing gaze.

For that, Rainbow Dash couldn’t help but smile to herself.

[---]

"And that's what really happened," Rainbow Dash concluded, lowering her gaze.

"Oh my goodness! But why did you do all that?" Fluttershy asked, distressed, the moment her friend finished speaking.

"I... I just wanted to give Twilight an amazing day, something better than what you all had planned," Rainbow Dash replied in a subdued voice. "But when things started going wrong, I panicked and… ended up in this mess."

The others looked at her silently, their eyes filled with a mix of concern and sympathy. Feeling uncomfortable under their gazes, Rainbow Dash turned her back to them.

"Anyway, now I have to go fulfill Magi’s contract if I don’t want to end up in prison or something worse. Tell Twilight I’ll see her—"

"Hold it right there, Rainbow Dash," Rarity interrupted firmly. "You don’t think we’re just going to let you go that easily, do you?"

"What…? What are you—?" Before she could finish, Applejack’s lasso flew through the air, wrapping tightly around her body and pulling her to the ground. Applejack quickly pinned her down, making sure she couldn’t escape.

"WHAT THE HECK DO YOU THINK YOU’RE—?!" Rainbow Dash managed to shout before Pinkie Pie stuffed a box of muffins into her mouth.

"We’re helping a friend keep her promise. That’s what we’re doing," Pinkie explained with a carefree smile, settling in next to Rainbow to hold her down. Fluttershy joined in on the other side, though her expression was far more apologetic.

Rainbow Dash could only glare helplessly as Rarity approached Magi with her usual elegance.

"Magi, darling, would you be interested in hearing a proposal that might allow our dear friend Rainbow Dash to stay with us today?" Rarity asked with determination, offering a poised smile.

"I’m listening," Magi replied calmly, maintaining her composed demeanor.

"As you surely know, I am the proud owner of several boutiques across Equestria. As a young entrepreneur, I’m always looking to expand my horizons, and partnering with your consortium would be a tremendous opportunity for my business. Of course, I’d need to carefully consider the benefits your organization provides, but you can consider me highly interested in becoming part of your community," Rarity finished persuasively.

Meanwhile, Rainbow Dash, still trapped, struggled with all her might. Her eyes were filled with desperation, but her plight didn’t seem to faze Magi in the slightest.

"An intriguing proposal," Magi replied. "Unfortunately, as I mentioned before your friend returned, Rainbow Dash’s situation is beyond my direct control. The consortium board won’t accept her absence from today’s meeting simply because..." She paused, noticing the disheartened expressions of the ponies before her.

Her gaze lingered on Pinkie Pie, who was holding up a sign that read "PLEASE" alongside a sad little doodle of a face. Magi blinked, momentarily taken aback, and began to waver. After a few moments of silence, during which she weighed her options, she let out a resigned sigh.

"However… I could say I was unable to find her."

The train car erupted in cheers. But before the group could celebrate too much, Magi raised her voice again.

"On the other hand, I had the pleasure of meeting the extraordinary friends of the princess, who expressed a keen interest in visiting the Average Consortium’s headquarters. What do you say? Are you in agreement?"

Rarity turned to her friends, who nodded enthusiastically. None of them opposed the idea—except for Rainbow Dash, who was still trapped by Applejack and shook her head vigorously, though to no avail.

"Yes, we’re absolutely in agreement," Rarity replied without hesitation.

"Excellent. I’ll be expecting you, then," Magi said with a satisfied smile.

Applejack finally released Rainbow Dash, who wasted no time jumping to her hooves and glaring at her friends. "WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?! DID YOU NOT HEAR EVERYTHING I SAID ABOUT HER?!"

"We understand perfectly, Rainbow Dash. But it’s not the first time we’ve dealt with merchants of this kind. No offense," Rarity added quickly, casting a glance at Magi.

"None taken," Magi replied, sipping casually from a soft drink as she lounged in one of the seats.

"Rainbow, we’ve taken far greater risks in the past. Have you forgotten that?" Applejack asked firmly.

"But this is different!" Dash shot back. "It’s not some monster or weird threat trying to destroy Equestria. It’s MY STUPID MISTAKE! You shouldn’t have to deal with this too," she said, frustration evident as small tears began to well up in her eyes.

"There, there, Dashi, it’s not that bad. We all make mistakes. Plus, it’s just a visit to some shady company where they might brainwash us," Pinkie Pie chimed in, leaning casually on Dash. Behind them, Magi raised an intrigued eyebrow.

"You can always count on us. And don’t forget Twilight; I’m sure she could help you sort out your legal mess," Fluttershy added softly, moving closer to Dash’s other side.

"That’s true, she could help. Wait... Twilight! WE STILL HAVEN’T PICKED WHO’S IN CHARGE OF TODAY’S SURPRISE!" Dash suddenly blurted out, panic crossing her face.

"Don’t worry about that, silly, I’ll give up my turn," Pinkie Pie said with her trademark beaming smile, not a hint of regret in her voice.

"Me too," Fluttershy added sweetly, smiling warmly.

"Girls... you..." Dash couldn’t hold back her tears any longer. Soon, they were all wrapped in a group hug, just as they had done so many times before.

Outside, the sun continued to shine brightly as the train sped through the vast prairie once more.

While the group of friends enjoyed their heartfelt embrace, Magi watched them silently, a contemplative look in her eyes. "Was this the magic of friendship I’ve heard so much about?" Something deep and shadowy within the executive pegasus stirred. Finally, she rose from her seat.

"Excuse the interruption, but are you really okay being so separate?" Magi said, now standing in the middle of the aisle.

Applejack and the others turned to look at her. Though Magi’s expression remained pleasant and understanding, there was a subtle note of irritation in her voice.

"What do you mean, darling?" Rarity asked, raising an eyebrow with curiosity.

"Girls, you’re an incredible team. You’ve accomplished remarkable things together. Earth ponies, pegasi, and unicorns across Equestria look up to you. So why not stay together as a team and rule directly alongside Princess Twilight on her throne?"

The five friends exchanged glances. After several moments of silence, it was Applejack who stepped forward to respond.

"Listen, Magi, it’s true each of us has great talents, and yes, we’ve done incredible things together with Twilight. But ruling Equestria with her like that wouldn’t be the right thing to do," Applejack said firmly.

"Not the right thing? How can that be?" Magi asked, sounding almost offended.

"When we first met Twilight, she was on a mission to learn about the magic of friendship in our home, Ponyville. From that moment, Twilight began learning many lessons about friendship from us. But we also learned from her. One of the first lessons she taught us was that everything has its place and its time. Of course, we’d all love to spend more time by her side, but if we did, eventually we’d become a burden, and that might stop her from growing into the great princess she’s meant to be. We want the best for our friend. That’s why, in this case, we step aside," Applejack concluded solemnly, her friends nodding silently in agreement, backing her words.

Magi watched in disbelief, unable to process what she had just heard.

"Besides, none of us would really know how to act properly as royalty..." Applejack added, only to be interrupted by a soft clearing of the throat behind her.

"…Well, some of us might," Rarity interjected with a lofty air.

Laughter quickly filled the train car as Rarity pretended to scold them. "But it’s true!" she huffed dramatically.

Magi observed the group of friends laughing together, as if the conflict from moments ago had never happened.

"Honestly, I..." Magi started, still incredulous, but quickly stopped herself. "...I still can’t quite understand it."

"It’s not that hard. Like they say, if you love something, let it go," Applejack replied with heartfelt simplicity.

"NEVER!" Magi blurted out suddenly, before catching herself awkwardly. "Uh… I mean, I’ve never quite understood that saying. Let go of what you love? Ha, ha… sounds a bit silly, doesn’t it? Ha, ha."

Her sudden shift in tone didn’t go unnoticed. Applejack’s words had struck a nerve, and Magi, without meaning to, had revealed a glimpse of her true self.

Applejack and the others exchanged curious glances, their attention now fully on the executive pegasus.

Magi took a nervous step back.

"Hey, are you okay?" Applejack asked, frowning slightly.

"No! Well... yes, yes. I just remembered I have another meeting. Oh my, look at the time!" Magi replied hastily, beginning to shove the materials from her presentation into her bag. She glanced at the ponies out of the corner of her eye, noticing the growing suspicion in their expressions.

This wasn’t good. Things hadn’t gone as planned. Her original strategy had been to divide them, and if that failed, at least to earn their trust. But now she had accomplished neither, and her carefully crafted image was starting to crack. She needed to retreat and reconsider her approach immediately.

"Oh dear! I can’t seem to find my travel brochures. Could someone open the windows? It’s so dark, I can’t see a thing," Magi said, feigning concern as she rummaged frantically through her bag. In truth, she was already calculating her escape, her eyes darting briefly to the hatch on the roof of the train car.

"The windows are already open," Pinkie Pie said, her tone puzzled.

Magi, along with everyone else, realized it was true.

It was strange. It was barely past midday, yet outside it was as dark as if night were falling.

Then, the train’s whistle let out a piercing, shrieking wail that echoed through the car, startling everyone. A split second later, chaos erupted.

[---]

Suddenly, the train bound for Canterlot had screeched to a halt.

Before anypony could react, the six friends were thrown by the momentum, tumbling into a tangled heap at one end of the car. The lights went out in an instant, and the shrill screech of the brakes filled the air for several seconds until, finally, the train stopped completely.

Inside the darkened cars, fear and confusion spread among the passengers. Outside, the darkness was absolute, as though night had fallen in the blink of an eye.

In the car with the group of friends, the chaos was no different.

"Girls, is everyone okay? Ow, my wing!"

"Could you get off me?"

"I can’t feel my tail!"

"Mmphh… I’ve got… a hoof… urgh… in my mouth!"

"Uhmmm uhmmmm uhmmmm."

Rainbow Dash was the first to react. She shoved whoever was on top of her aside and began fumbling around for the emergency switch. Moments later, a dim red light illuminated the car, revealing the disarray.

Just as she thought, Fluttershy was lying on top of her. The yellow pegasus, dazed, slid off and collapsed onto one of the seats. Nearby, the rest of the group was a jumble of limbs and disheveled manes.

"This is no time to rest, Fluttershy!" Rainbow Dash scolded, pushing herself to her hooves. "Help me get the others up, now!"

"Y-yes, right away," Fluttershy stammered, shaking her head to clear it. With renewed focus, she hurried to assist Dash in untangling the rest of the group.

Soon, everypony was back on their hooves.

"Cough, cough! Thank heavens!" exclaimed Rarity with a dramatic sigh of relief. She was the first to stand, spitting out Applejack’s left boot, which had somehow ended up in her mouth.

"Thanks, Fluttershy. But… I still can’t feel my tail..." Pinkie Pie murmured as she wobbled to her hooves. Indeed, her signature fluffy tail had deflated into a limp and bedraggled mess.

Rainbow Dash, now helping Applejack up, barely glanced in her direction.

"Well, that was one wild jolt! Is everypony okay?" Applejack asked, shaking off the last of her disorientation. Despite having been at the bottom of the pile, she seemed unfazed—and remarkably, her hat was still firmly in place. Ironically, Pinkie’s tail had cushioned much of the impact for her.

"I’m good," Rainbow Dash replied, scanning the rest of the car. "But… they don’t look so great."

Behind Applejack, the others had gathered around Rarity, who had lit up her horn, casting a soft glow over their immediate surroundings. At some point, the emergency lights had failed, leaving the rest of the car in unnerving shadows.

"Don’t worry, Applejack. We’re just a bit rattled from this dreadful accident," Rarity said, using her light to inspect her friends and the scattered luggage on the floor. Suddenly, she gasped. "What is this mess?! And where’s my travel case? My imported beauty supplies!"

"Okay, everypony’s fine. Now we need to—" Applejack tried to interject, ignoring Rarity’s rising panic. But then, another voice cut her off.

"Wait... everypony?" Pinkie Pie’s expression suddenly turned sharp. "Isn’t somepony missing?"

The five friends froze, realization dawning on them. Magi was nowhere to be seen.

Frantically, they scanned the car. Fluttershy was the first to notice something unusual. "Look over there," she whispered, trembling, pointing a hoof toward the far end of the train car.

A massive yellow sphere had appeared between the seats, blocking the exit on that side of the train.

Stunned by the unexpected sight, the ponies exchanged bewildered glances. Rainbow Dash and Applejack, however, were the first to act. With just a few shared looks, they seemed to come to an unspoken agreement and began moving toward the mysterious object, the others following close behind.

As they approached, the details of the anomaly grew clearer with every step. It was nothing ordinary; more than just a sphere, it resembled a giant egg, large enough to easily fit a pony inside.

Applejack, stepping close enough to see the surface, noticed some writing on it. Squinting, she read aloud:
"High-Impact Protection Capsule - Average C... huh?" Her confusion was evident.

Just then, a hissing sound, like air escaping a balloon, emanated from the giant egg. It began to deflate, and the silhouette of a pony emerged from the collapsing shell. Suddenly, one side of the egg tore open, and a disgruntled pegasus stumbled out.

"Ugh! Gross! Those tech idiots! Cough! I told them to include air fresheners in the capsule! Cough!" Magi grumbled as she extricated herself from the remains of the capsule, which now emitted a foul stench of rotten eggs. "No matter... what in Equestria just happened?"

Magi locked eyes with the other ponies. Their faces showed unrestrained shock. The executive pegasus had red-rimmed eyes and an expression so stormy it overshadowed any memory of the kind and understanding demeanor she had shown earlier.

After a tense few seconds of silence, Magi quickly composed herself, forcing a strained smile as she glanced back at the group.
"What a relief! You’re all safe!" she exclaimed, though her tone betrayed her irritation.

Rainbow Dash was the first to respond.
"Don’t bother keeping up the act, Magi. We’re past that now," she said firmly, her voice cutting through the tension.

Magi’s gaze darted to each of them. The stern expressions meeting her own made it clear they all agreed with Rainbow Dash.

After a moment of hesitation, Magi sighed, her face settling into a cold, serious look that seemed much more fitting.
"Fine. What did I miss? What’s going on?"

No one answered.

The silence was broken by a creaking sound coming from the rear door of the train car. All eyes turned toward it. The door became engulfed in a radiant pink magic, and from the blinding glow, a figure began to emerge.

Barely visible through the intense light, it quickly became apparent this was no ordinary pony.

As the light dimmed, the figure was revealed: an enigmatic and unfamiliar pony. The newcomer had short, pink hair matching the hue of their piercing eyes, with a thick brown streak running through a blunt fringe. They wore a gleaming black alicorn-like armor that seemed to shimmer with an otherworldly energy.

On the chest of the armor was a relief of a silver tree surrounded by six stars, and embedded in the neckline was a radiant pink gem. Though clearly a colt, he seemed younger than anypony present. His steps were steady and imposing as he approached the group, leaving the ponies—and even Magi—momentarily speechless.

"GREETINGS, BEARERS OF THE ELEMENTS OF HARMONY," the mysterious pony declared in a booming voice that sent chills down everypony’s spine. "PLEASE, JOIN ME AS WE AWAIT THE FULFILLMENT OF YOUR DESTINIES."

The chilling proclamation left the entire group frozen, the air around them heavy with an unshakable sense of dread.
