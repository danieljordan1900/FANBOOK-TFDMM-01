On the train bound for Canterlot, inside one of the cargo cars, nestled among stacked crates and bulky luggage, a young pony sat shrouded in oppressive darkness. His face, faintly illuminated by the dim light filtering through the hatch above, betrayed nervousness. He hadn’t slept the previous night and had gone hours without eating. Yet none of this was the true source of his unease. His spirit remained strong, his mind sharp and alert.

Rather, it was his clarity of thought—the cruel awareness of his situation—that fed his anguish.

The moment of his ultimate test was drawing near.

Trying to steady his nerves, he grabbed the bottle of cider his mentors had given him as a parting gift before he boarded the train. It was his first time trying cider, and at the first sip, the burning sensation in his throat provoked a dry cough that echoed through the silence of the car. Despite the discomfort, he kept drinking, finishing about a third of the bottle before setting it aside. Slowly, the warmth of the drink began to ease the trembling in his hooves, and his mind grew even clearer.

With some time to spare, he turned on the music player he had brought along, slipped on his headphones, and, feeling slightly more relaxed, let himself sink to the floor.

The headphones were so new that the box still lay beside him, untouched except for the broken seal. Another gift he hadn’t asked for, but also couldn’t refuse. He likely wouldn’t have another chance to use something so sophisticated in his life.

Curious about the sleek device, he picked up the box and read aloud: "Gamma Silente Headphones - Averages C."

[hr]

"...and that’s what happened," Rainbow Dash concluded confidently. Before her, her friends listened attentively.

"Wow! That was incredible. You fought a giant crocodile, saved Daring Do from being devoured by a swarm of locust ants, and restored peace to a kingdom of hippos. You’re amazing, Dashi!" Pinkie Pie exclaimed excitedly, bouncing in her seat.

"Yeah, that sure is an 'incredible' story, Rainbow," Applejack commented, her tone dripping with skepticism as she cast a sidelong glance at Rarity.

"And after all that, Daring Do gave you the original draft of her latest book. Wow..." Fluttershy murmured softly, her hooves idly fiddling with the saddlebag at her side.

"Exactly! That’s how it went. Definitely," Dash confirmed, radiating a confidence that almost dared anyone to challenge her.

The four ponies glanced at the pile of disorganized, battered documents Rainbow Dash had proudly placed on one of the seats moments before.

"We understand these documents are very valuable, darling. And since you brought them to our little gathering today, I suppose this is also the big surprise you’ve prepared for Twilight, isn’t it?" Rarity asked, narrowing her eyes.

"Of course!" Dash exclaimed enthusiastically. "Knowing her, she’s probably already read the book ten times. But I’m sure she’ll be super impressed when she sees this."

Rainbow Dash had envisioned that moment over and over. Her friends would flood her with questions and praises for her brilliant idea, and she’d respond to each one with gusto. If she could just avoid mentioning the other dangerous matter, everything she’d gone through to get those documents would have been worth it.

I just need her approval... nothing else.

Carefully masking her emotions, Dash waited with a smile. But...

None of that happened.

Instead, her friends exchanged glances in silence, their faces reflecting concern.

"What’s wrong?" Dash asked, feeling a chill of unease as she noticed the lack of enthusiasm. "Don’t you think she’ll be surprised?"

Though her face showed no hint of doubt, a growing fear twisted in her stomach.

"Of course she’ll be surprised," Applejack replied in a calm but firm tone. "It’s just that your story doesn’t explain what happened earlier."

A slight twitch in Dash’s eyelid betrayed her nerves, though she didn’t notice it herself.

"Explain what?" she shot back quickly, feigning innocence.

"Who was that suspicious pony we saw before?" Applejack asked seriously, fixing her gaze on Dash.

"Oh, that? It’s nothing important," Dash replied with a casual shrug and a forced laugh. "Just a fan I ran into. She wants me to sign a contract to be her star model. Funny, right?"

Her words, deliberately simple, barely convinced anyone. Applejack frowned, and Rarity raised an eyebrow, her skepticism plain.

"A fan...?" Applejack pressed, her tone growing more inquisitive.

"Well, you should talk to her. She shouldn’t be sneaking around like that. It’ll only cause trouble, and you’ll end up more stressed than you already are," Pinkie chimed in, pulling a muffin from nowhere and taking a carefree bite. The others shot her brief, reproachful looks; they all knew Pinkie wasn’t the best authority on this subject, given her history of similar behavior.

"Stressed? What are you talking about, Pinkie? I’m perfectly fine," Dash retorted with a mix of irritation and defiance.

"Pinkie’s right, darling. You look awful. Have you seen yourself in a mirror?" Rarity added in her typical tone of exaggerated concern for appearances.

Rainbow scowled, feeling a twinge of irritation. She usually didn’t trust Rarity’s opinions on her looks, finding them overly dramatic. But the seed of doubt had been planted, so she turned to the friend she knew would never lie to her.

"Fluttershy, do I really look that bad?" she asked, shifting her gaze away from Applejack.

"Well... you don’t look that bad, but when you arrived, I was really worried. Well, we all were," Fluttershy admitted in her gentle tone, pulling out a small mirror and offering it to Dash.

Reluctantly, Rainbow glanced at her reflection. Fluttershy was right. Her mane was more disheveled than usual, her eyes were slightly bloodshot, and faint dark circles lingered beneath them. Though she still thought she looked spectacular—by her own standards—she wasn’t at her best.

"Well, I think you should talk to your ‘fan’ and sort things out," Applejack interjected firmly. "Today’s a special day for Twilight, and it wouldn’t be fair to ruin it with these kinds of problems."

Dash rolled her eyes in exasperation and let out a sigh. "Pfft! You worry too much, Applejack! Everything’s fine!"

At that moment, the chime of the car’s bell interrupted the conversation. Moments later, a train attendant poked his head in, accompanied by the growing buzz of young voices from the other side of the door.

"Excuse me, is Miss Rainbow Dash here? There are several foals outside eager to meet her," the attendant announced kindly. The noise from beyond grew louder, filled with excited shouts and cheers for the pegasus.

Rainbow Dash’s friends, who had turned their attention to the announcement, turned back to look for her... but where their friend should have been was now empty space.

"Rainbow?" Applejack asked, blinking as she scanned the car.

A few steps ahead, Dash’s outline was visible. Her head stuck out the window, and the rest of her body was poised in a suspiciously ready-to-jump position.

"Ha, ha! It’s so hot today, isn’t it?" Dash commented nervously, slowly returning to the center of the car while avoiding her friends’ inquisitive gazes.

[hr]

The train car erupted into a deafening roar of cheers and cries of excitement.

"IT'S RAINBOW DASH!"
"SHE'S AMAZING!"
"YEAH!"

The foals crowded around their idol, bursting with joy. Her friends watched with amused smiles—except Applejack, who wore a skeptical expression.

"Alright, I’ve got this," Dash said, visibly perking up. She left her friends behind and confidently approached the eager group. "Wow! So, I’m guessing you’re all here for an autograph, right?"

"YEEEESSSSS!" the young ponies neighed, some jumping and others stamping their hooves in a frenzy of enthusiasm.

The thunderous cheers and the reflection of her own figure in her fans’ bright eyes rekindled Rainbow Dash’s spirit. She spread her wings, lifted into the air, and struck her most iconic pose. Any traces of fatigue or weakness melted away, as if the ovation itself had magically cured her exhaustion.

"Alright, alright, calm down. Form a line and hand me something to sign." Dash landed near a seat and, as if rehearsed, pulled a pen from her mane. "Okay, who’s first?"

Without hesitation, the foals and fillies lined up neatly. The first in line was a filly wearing a pink hat and ribbon, holding what appeared to be a cookbook. With a radiant smile, she handed it to Dash.

"Huh? You’re sure you want me to sign this? Works for me." Dash quickly signed the open book.

"YESS! Of course! Your blackberry pie recipe is just like my grandma’s!" the filly exclaimed excitedly before hopping away from the line.

"Uh...?" Dash murmured, confused. Behind her, Pinkie Pie could be heard choking on a muffin, but Dash decided to ignore it. "Alright... next!"

"Me! Me! Over here!" said a colt with blue fur and white sneakers, handing Dash a travel sneaker brochure.

"Now this is more like it! Here you go." Dash signed the brochure without hesitation.

"Awesome! Now my parents will HAVE to buy me the same sneakers you wear. YEEEAH!" the colt shouted as he ran off in excitement.

Behind Dash, her friends exchanged whispers. Dash didn’t turn around, but her smile began to falter as an uncomfortable feeling crept over her. Something didn’t add up.

All her friends knew perfectly well that Rainbow Dash didn’t wear sneakers.

"Alright, you!" Dash said, pointing a hoof at the next filly in line, a young pony with stickers on her face. "Where do you want me to sign?"

"In my fashion magazine!" the filly chirped cheerfully.

"And that’s because...?" Dash asked, a knot forming in her stomach.

"Because I LOVE your makeup! Your sparkles and stickers are divine! Eeeep!" the filly squealed.

Rainbow Dash practically snatched the magazine from her hooves. As she flipped through it, a pained expression crossed her face.

"Alright, here’s your autograph," Dash said curtly, handing back the magazine and ushering the filly away. Then, she turned to the remaining line.

"THANKS FOR COMING, BUT THAT’S ALL FOR NOW!" she suddenly exclaimed.

A murmur of confusion spread through the foals, but before they could protest, Dash raised a hoof and added:

"I’LL KEEP SIGNING AUTOGRAPHS AT THE NEXT STATION! I PROMISE! RAINBOW DASH’S WORD!"

Perhaps out of sheer trust in her or simple politeness, most complied, though a few grumbled their disappointment. With the train attendant’s help, Rainbow Dash quickly guided the young ponies out of the car.

Dash let out a tired sigh as she closed the door behind the last of the foals. She had solved one problem, but now she felt a bigger one looming over her.

"Wow, Rainbow, I didn’t know you liked wearing sneakers," Pinkie Pie commented, inspecting a brochure one of the foals had dropped.

Before a second passed, Dash reacted with lightning speed. She snatched the brochure from Pinkie and hastily gathered all the others scattered on the floor, throwing them out one of the train windows.

"Ugh, wow. These kids really need to be more careful about where they leave their trash. Cleanliness is important! Don’t you think?" Dash said, slightly out of breath, as she shut the window with a forced smile.

Her friends stared at her, perplexed. Though they exchanged murmurs, trying to brush the matter aside, Applejack wasn’t about to let it go.

"That’s it! Rainbow Dash, what are you hiding?" the farm pony demanded, her tone firm as she stepped closer to the pegasus.

"Hiding something? What could I possibly be hiding?" Dash replied, letting out a tense, nervous laugh.

"Ever since you got here, I’ve felt like somethin’ AIN’T RIGHT. And when somethin’ AIN’T RIGHT, I can’t just sit quiet. I’m askin’ you again: WHAT ARE YOU HIDING, RAINBOW DASH?"

"Hey, calm down, Applejack. Everything’s fine. I’m not hiding anything, right, girls?" Dash looked to her other friends for support, but silence was her only answer.

Feeling the weight of her friends’ disapproval, Dash decided she’d had enough. With a sharp, annoyed tone, she spoke:

"You know what? I just remembered I need to buy something. I’ll go ahead. See you in Canterlot."

"You—!" Applejack tried to protest, clearly upset, but was interrupted by an unexpected voice.

"Leaving so soon, Rainbow Dash? I thought you’d want to spend more time with your friends," said an unfamiliar voice from the other end of the car.

All heads turned toward the back. There, lounging comfortably with a soda can in hoof, was none other than Magazine Doublereport.

[hr]

The train's progress had slowed. In the middle of a wide plain, peaceful flocks of sheep casually crossed the tracks, disrupting the train's path and irritating the rushed engineers, whose schedule was already "way" behind.  

Meanwhile, in the special guest car, a much more active situation was unfolding. A mysterious pegasus with white fur and a red mane with black stripes had suddenly barged into the gathering of friends. Standing up, the unknown mare approached the ponies with a playful look and a radiant smile. Her posture, exuding nothing but confidence, was that of a successful city businesspony. And indeed, that was exactly what she was. The yellow tie she wore, the office accessories protruding from her stylish saddlebag, and the intense perfume she radiated were all clues to her role.  

Magazine Doublereport needed no introduction; her image spoke for itself, especially the corporate nameplate on her chest featuring a sophisticated "A" in red, black, and white.  

Of course, as a businesspony, she had to introduce herself, but far from being bored by the theatrics, she greatly enjoyed them.  

And in that moment, Magi (as she preferred to be called) was enjoying it even more as she noticed, while approaching, the faint glimmer of fear in Rainbow Dash’s eyes.  

"Hi! It’s such a pleasure to meet you all! I’m Magazine Doublereport, owner and CEO of the Averages Consortium. You can call me 'MAGI.' It’s a pleasure to meet the heroic and acclaimed friends of Princess Twilight Sparkle!" Magi quickly announced with an enthusiastic exclamation that almost sounded like a neigh.  

One by one, Magi greeted Rarity, Pinkie Pie, and Fluttershy, handing each of them a promotional brochure with a charming smile.  

"Hey, you’re not the same pony from earlier..." Applejack remarked, eyeing her with suspicion.  

"AND you must be Applejack, nice to meet you!" Magi responded, shaking the farmer's hoof so enthusiastically that Applejack ended up falling to the side, visibly dizzy.  

After completing the greetings, Magi turned toward everyone with a confident attitude.  

"Sorry to interrupt, but I just need a moment with your friend Rainbow Dash," she announced, walking over to the pegasus. "Your friends look just as cool as you told me, Dash. You should’ve let me know you were meeting with them! Bad move! But hey, no worries. I’m not mad at you for that, partner. More importantly, I need you to sign a few documents to include the Crystal Empire in the marketing campaign. The 'Dash Splash' cleaning accessories are a huge hit. Good name, don’t you think? Dash... Dash?"  

Rainbow Dash didn’t respond. Her gaze was fixed on the brochures her friends were holding.  

Pinkie Pie stifled a laugh as she looked at a pajama brochure where Rainbow was wearing bunny ears. Rarity, surprised, was examining a fashion brochure where Dash wore a stylish spring outfit. Fluttershy, frozen—no, more like paralyzed—held a "friendly hunting" brochure with images of stuffed animals.  

Without warning, Rainbow Dash shot out of the nearest window, leaving her friends in stunned silence.  

"Great! There she goes again. Is she always like this?" Magi asked, her tone a mix of irritation and surprise.  

"Who did you say you were?" Applejack interjected, trying to recover from the previous greeting.  

"Excuse me, Miss Magi," Rarity said, stepping forward courteously. "But what’s your relationship with our friend Rainbow Dash?"  

"I’m her legal representative and manager," Magi answered calmly as she settled into a nearby seat.  

"Rainbow Dash has a manager?" Pinkie asked, tilting her head in clear confusion.  

The others exchanged glances, equally bewildered by the unexpected revelation.  

"I think I’ve heard of the Averages Consortium before..." murmured Rarity, deep in thought. After a brief pause, she added with a more serious tone: "Miss Magi, this is really surprising for all of us. Could you explain this a little more, please?"  

"Of course, Miss Rarity. You see, your friend Rainbow Dash recently signed a 'binding contract' with the Averages Consortium, allowing us to use her image and name. And due to her status as a top-tier client, I personally took on the responsibility of handling all legal aspects related to her. It’s quite a challenge, considering how 'busy' her daily schedule tends to be. But it’s a key investment to turn her into the *new* and biggest celebrity in all of Equestria!" Magi explained with a triumphant smile, as if announcing the greatest achievement of her career.  

By the end of her explanation, Rarity was completely stunned, just like the rest of her friends.  

Well, not all of them.  

Applejack, who had maintained a neutral expression throughout the conversation, had already figured out the kind of news Magi would share. The phrase "binding contract" only confirmed her suspicions. She wasn’t a legal expert like Twilight, but her grandmother had told her enough stories about such documents to know they didn’t bode well.  

"So she did that..." Applejack murmured, piecing the puzzle together in her mind. Then, with a firm tone, she added: "So that’s why she’s been chasing after our friend, right, Miss 'Magi'?"  

Magi, sensing the pressure in Applejack’s voice and anticipating the direction the conversation would take, quickly responded.

"I’d like to avoid any misunderstandings between us. Miss Rainbow Dash received a fair deal and was fully informed of the extent of the document she signed with my organization. Therefore, I simply make sure she fulfills her end of the agreement," Magi explained, her tone smooth.

"Fulfill the agreement? And what does that mean?" Applejack retorted, staring at her intently.

Magi let out a barely perceptible sigh. "Well, it’s unfortunately a long explanation. I don’t think you and your friends have the time..."

"We do!" Applejack interrupted, her voice firm and resolute. Her friends immediately nodded, making it clear they were ready to listen.

On the other hand, Magi wasn’t as enthusiastic.

"Alright," Magi accepted with a slight nod of her head. Inside, she sighed again, resigned to give an explanation she wasn’t fond of but felt was necessary to maintain control of the situation and move forward with her objectives.

Without further delay, Magi proceeded to explain how, after meeting Rainbow Dash and getting her to sign a binding contract at the main offices of the Averages Consortium in Manehattan several days ago, she and her partners had begun using her image in advertising campaigns. She detailed that, although the brochures featured ponies who looked like Rainbow Dash, they weren’t actually her but models carefully made up to replicate her colors. Magi emphasized that Rainbow had given her in-person approval of these strategies during a meeting, implying that everything had been handled professionally.

However, Magi left out an important part of the story. The reality was that everything had been achieved through lies and carefully executed manipulations to obtain Rainbow Dash's consent.

Unfortunately, that was the case—contrary to the image she projected, Magi wasn’t a good pony, and her methods made that clear. Her approach consisted of half-truths combined with manipulation tactics and, at times, subtle threats. As a businesspony, she always did it with a radiant smile, which wasn’t fake; she genuinely enjoyed the dark satisfaction of having control over others.

And if all of that didn’t work, she always had other, more 'convincing' resources to fall back on...

When Magi finished her explanation, an unsettling sense of doubt hung in the air between the friends.

"But why would Rainbow Dash want to become a commercial celebrity? She doesn’t seek that kind of fame," Fluttershy exclaimed, genuinely concerned for her friend.

"At first, your friend Rainbow Dash showed no interest in my proposal," Magi replied calmly, taking a sip of her drink. "However, she changed her mind when I included the opportunity to acquire the original drafts of the latest Daring Do book. She was very excited to get them. I believe she mentioned something about 'winning a very special competition.' Though, I’m not sure what she meant by that..."

The four friends exchanged glances, then looked toward the stack of documents on one of the seats. Slowly, everything began to make sense. Three years ago, the five of them had made a promise to surprise or celebrate Twilight on a day like this. They hadn’t specified what kind of celebration it would be—it could have been a party, a gift, or some special gesture—but they had made it clear they would do it without a competitive spirit, supporting each other. Now, recent events indicated that Rainbow Dash had decided to ignore that rule.

"This is really shocking, Miss Magi. We would like to know more about this delicate matter, if you don’t mind giving us a bit more of your time..." Rarity said, already sensing the gravity of the problem Rainbow Dash had gotten herself into.

"I don’t mind at all, Miss Rarity," Magi responded quickly in a colder tone than before. "However, I don’t have much time to provide further explanations. I have a meeting with the executives of the Averages Consortium today, and my star client, Rainbow Dash, must be present. I’m obligated to take her to our offices in Manehattan, or else her 'friend' could face serious legal problems. I don’t want that to happen, and I imagine you don’t either. So, if you’ll allow me..."

"Don’t worry about that, I’ll go get her," Applejack interrupted abruptly.

"Do you know where she is?" asked Rarity, surprised, joined by Pinkie Pie’s exclamation.

Applejack nodded. Her confidence was enough to stop further questions from her friends. Magi, noticing the gesture, raised an eyebrow slightly.

"Can you really bring her?" Magi asked, her tone inquisitive.

"Yes, and I don’t need anyone to come with me," Applejack confirmed, making it clear she wasn’t willing to negotiate.

Magi pondered the idea while taking another sip of her drink, before finally making her decision.

"Alright, I’ll trust you, Miss Applejack. I’d appreciate it if you did. Then... I’ll wait here until you return. But no more than 20 minutes," Magi said, accepting Applejack’s proposal, though with some distrust.

"I won’t take that long. I’ll be right back," Applejack assured, adjusting her hat before quickly leaving through the back door of the car.

The rest of her friends watched her leave, worried. They all wondered what was going on with Rainbow Dash and hoped with all their hearts that Applejack would manage to bring her back.

Meanwhile, Magi...

"I have samples of the new Jumy Cookies with ginger flavor. Would anyone like some?" she offered nonchalantly.

"I want some!" Pinkie Pie exclaimed, raising her right hoof excitedly.

[hr]

On the delayed train heading from Ponyville to Canterlot, Applejack trotted toward the last car. When she arrived, she discovered that it was locked, which didn’t surprise her, since it was a special cargo car. However, something caught her attention: it was heavily secured, with the windows sealed and the doors reinforced. Despite her curiosity, she decided not to pay it much mind. She had an important mission to complete. Determined, she climbed a small ladder to the roof of the car, searching for her friend.

Soon, she spotted the silhouette she was looking for. It was Rainbow Dash, sitting at the far end of the car’s roof. Her figure stood out against the horizon; her rainbow-colored mane appeared dull, and her wings hung limp at her sides. She was motionless, staring off into some distant point along the path the train was leaving behind.

Without saying a word, Applejack walked over and sat beside her. Rainbow Dash didn’t react.

“Well... you came,” Rainbow finally said, pulling herself out of her thoughts and turning toward her friend.

"Yeah," Applejack replied calmly.

"How did you know I’d be here?"

"I had a hunch. I didn’t think you’d really leave us, so I thought about the part of the train that would make you feel most comfortable... you like to see things in motion. Don’t you?"

Rainbow let out a faint sigh, turning her gaze back to the train tracks. "Yeah, that’s true. I like watching things move."

The two friends watched in silence as the landscape unfolded before them: a peaceful green plain lit by the midday sun, its serenity only interrupted by the disorganized movement of sheep herds.

After a while in silence, Applejack spoke again.

"Magi already told us part of what happened, but I don’t think she’s being fully honest, so I want to hear it from you."

"Great..." Rainbow murmured, not looking at her.

Applejack waited, but Rainbow remained quiet. Noticing the pause was becoming too long, Applejack decided to press on.

"So, are you gonna tell me what happened?"

"It’s not your problem," came the blunt reply.

"Rainbow..."

"I’m serious. It’s not your problem. Or the others’. It’s just... I did something really stupid."

"And that’s why you don’t want to talk about it? You think you can fix it on your own?"

"Exactly."

Applejack sighed, almost rolling her eyes. Without warning, she stood up, raised her hoof, and gave the pegasus a soft but determined tap on the head.

"Ow! HEY!" Rainbow exclaimed, turning around, surprised and indignant by the sudden attack.

There she was before her, as expected, Applejack. An earth pony she had competed with countless times and shared all kinds of adventures with. That same pony, so familiar in her life, now gave her a hard, stern look, the kind only a member of the Apple family would give. But more than the glare of an angry farm pony, it was the furious gaze of a true friend.

"Tell me, Rainbow, when did my BRAVE BEST FRIEND turn into a COWARDLY CHICKEN?"

Rainbow Dash’s eyes flared with rage at her words, and a faint spark brought some life back to her dull mane. Applejack noticed the change and, though she felt a small spark of relief, remained resolute. She knew that, if she wanted to bring the real Rainbow Dash back, she would have to handle this situation with more care than "a cat with boots on a glass roof."

"I'M NOT A CHICKEN, AND THIS ISN'T YOUR BUSINESS!" Rainbow Dash shouted, her voice sharp.

"IS IT REALLY SO IMPORTANT THAT YOU’RE WILLING TO PUT OUR FRIENDSHIP ASIDE?" Applejack demanded firmly.

Rainbow’s silence was her only response. Applejack exhaled, disappointment evident. She turned and began walking away.

Rainbow Dash hesitated, but seeing her friend walk off, she shot into the air to follow her.

"HEY, WAIT! I’m not putting our friendship aside, I just don’t want you to get involved in this," Rainbow explained hurriedly as she caught up.

"IT’S THE SAME THING," Applejack replied, turning toward Rainbow.

"YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND!"

"THEN EXPLAIN IT... please," Applejack insisted, this time in a softer tone.

Rainbow Dash lowered her gaze, as though she were battling herself. Finally, she sighed and confessed, "It’s just... I’m really embarrassed."

Applejack looked at her, confused. "Is that it?"

"It’s not 'just that,'" Rainbow shot back, her voice filled with frustration.

"How bad is it?"

"Really bad," Rainbow answered quietly, falling silent for a moment before continuing, as if the words were heavy in her mouth. "After signing that stupid contract, they called me back. That’s when I found out they’d been doing cooking promotions with my image..."

Applejack raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "That doesn’t sound so bad, Rainbow. Magi told us that..."

"They also did beauty promotions," Rainbow interrupted, sweat beading on her forehead.

"Okay, but..."

"AND they did special mare clothing promotions for Heartwarming Day!" Rainbow finally exploded, covering her face with her wings, her cheeks turning bright red.

Applejack remained silent. After a moment, she asked cautiously, "Is there more?"

"Yeah... a lot more," Rainbow admitted, a mix of shame and fear in her eyes.

Silence settled again between them, broken only by the rhythmic clatter of the train’s wheels. During that moment, Applejack closed her eyes, reflecting on what she had just heard from her friend. She also recalled how Rainbow Dash had reacted in the past to embarrassing situations, like that time when unfounded rumors from a school newspaper nearly destroyed her public image. However, unlike that occasion, her friend wasn’t the victim of an external trick, but of her own poor decisions.

Knowing her friend’s immense pride, Applejack could only imagine the equally enormous mountain of shame on Rainbow Dash’s shoulders, crushing her from within.

Applejack sighed and broke the silence:

"This time, it looks like you’ve really gotten yourself neck-deep in the mud. And how many ponies get Magi’s magazines?"

"According to what she told me, by the end of next week, everypony in Equestria will have a copy. By then, my public image will be ruined," Dash replied, avoiding eye contact.

"And how did you plan on fixing it?"

"I’ll think of something... Like always!" Dash declared with a confident smile, though her diverted gaze gave away her lie.

The train continued its slow journey across the prairie. From their position on the roof of the car, Applejack and Rainbow Dash could see flocks of sheep grazing peacefully on the horizon. Some groups crossed the path the train was leaving behind, unaware of what was happening around them. The sheep continued with their routine, oblivious to everything.

The silence, already familiar in their conversation, returned between the two friends. It was heavy, but not uncomfortable, until Applejack, unable to hold back any longer, broke it once more.

"And all of this for a book?"

"Yeah..." Dash replied with a sigh. "It’s really dumb when I think about it now. I could’ve done something simpler, like a vacation trip or some kind of competition between us. But NO! I HAD TO DO SOMETHING UNIQUE, SOMETHING AMAZING, 'SOMETHING INCREDIBLE!'" she exclaimed, raising her front hooves dramatically before letting herself slump heavily back onto the car’s roof. "I think, deep down, I wanted to do something better than what you did."

"Rainbow, we promised we wouldn’t compete against each other. Not for this," Applejack reminded her firmly, but kindly.

"YES, I KNOW! ... I know," Dash sighed, exhausted. She let her ears droop as her gaze wandered over the landscape.

"The others need to hear it from you."

"Yeah, but... the looks they gave me. I won’t be able to stand it, Applejack. I..." 

"I’ll be there. They won’t laugh," Applejack assured her, gently placing her hoof on her friend's shoulder.

Rainbow Dash looked at her, moved. For a moment, her expression was that of a colt receiving forgiveness from their mother: warm and full of gratitude. But before Applejack could say anything more, Dash shook her mane, wiped her face with her wings, and straightened up.

The determined posture she was known for had returned. Applejack understood immediately and felt a sudden urge to jump with excitement, but she held herself back.

The real Rainbow Dash was back. Her emotional recovery had been quicker than Applejack had expected.

"Alright, Applejack. You win. I’ll tell them everything, but after that, I’ll have to go with Magi. She has a meeting... whatever, and I need to be there. I hope it’s quick... I think," Dash declared, her eyes gleaming with renewed confidence.

Applejack hadn’t anticipated that response. She briefly shifted her gaze toward the horizon, reflecting on her next words.

"If that’s really what you want, we’ll accept it," she said finally, part of her face hidden under the brim of her hat.

"Umph, thanks..." Dash frowned, sensing something suspicious in Applejack’s 'honest' words, but let it go. "Alright, let’s head back."

With the agility they both shared, Rainbow Dash and Applejack climbed down from the roof of the car and returned to the interior of the train.

After a short journey, they arrived at their destination car.

Inside, they found Magi and the rest of their friends. After a brief greeting and some exchange of words, Rainbow Dash took a deep breath. Then, facing her fears, she began her confession.

Though she left out some details about her stay at the Averages Tower, she was honest in describing how she had been treated and the circumstances that led her to sign the binding contract with Magi. She also told them about her return to the Average offices, her desperate attempt to evade Magi, and the inner struggle that had led her to that day on the train.

Throughout the explanation, Applejack stayed by her side, and no one interrupted her. Not even Pinkie Pie, who could only make faces while being pierced by her friend’s stern gaze.

Rainbow Dash could only smile to herself at that.

[hr]

"And that’s what really happened," Rainbow Dash concluded, lowering her gaze.

"Oh my goodness! But why did you do all of that?" Fluttershy asked, distressed, as soon as her friend finished speaking.

"I... I just wanted to give Twilight an amazing day, better than the one you all had planned," Rainbow Dash replied, her voice dull. "But when things started going wrong, I panicked and... ended up getting myself into this mess."

The others stared at her in silence, their eyes reflecting a mix of concern and pity. Uncomfortable under their gaze, Rainbow Dash turned around, giving them her back.

"Anyway, now I have to go fulfill the contract with Magi if I don’t want to end up in prison or worse. Tell Twilight I’ll see her..." 

"Hold on there, Rainbow Dash," Rarity interrupted firmly. "You don’t think we’re just going to let you go that easily, do you?"

"Huh? What...?" Before she could finish, Applejack’s lasso quickly wrapped around her body, pinning her down and throwing her to the ground. Applejack climbed on top of her, making sure she couldn’t escape.

"WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU’RE—?!" Rainbow managed to shout before Pinkie Pie shoved a box of muffins into her mouth.

"We’re helping a friend keep a promise. That’s what we’re doing," Pinkie explained with a carefree smile, settling beside her to hold her in place. Fluttershy joined from the other side, though with a much more apologetic expression.

Rainbow Dash could only look on helplessly as Rarity approached Magi with elegance.

"Magi, darling, would you be interested in hearing a proposal for how our friend Rainbow Dash could stay with us for the day?" Rarity asked with determination, offering a slight smile.

"I'm listening," Magi responded calmly, maintaining her poised demeanor.

"As you probably know, I own several boutiques across Equestria. As a young entrepreneur, I’m looking to expand my horizons, and joining your consortium would be a great opportunity for my business. Of course, I’d have to carefully review the benefits your organization offers, but you can consider that from today onward, I have a great interest in becoming part of your community," Rarity concluded persuasively.

Meanwhile, Rainbow, still trapped, struggled with all her might. Her eyes were full of desperation, but Magi didn’t seem too concerned with her situation.

"It’s an interesting proposal. Unfortunately, as I mentioned before your friend returned, Rainbow Dash’s situation is beyond my direct control," Magi responded seriously. "The consortium board will not accept that your friend refused to attend today’s meeting just because..." She stopped as she noticed the defeated faces of the group of ponies in front of her.

Especially striking was Pinkie Pie, who was holding a sign that said "PLEASE" along with a sad face. Magi blinked in surprise, beginning to waver. After observing them in silence for a few seconds, weighing her options, she finally let out a resigned sigh.

"However... I can tell you that I didn’t manage to find her."

The train car erupted in joy. But before they could celebrate too much, Magi raised her voice.

"Instead, I met the extraordinary friends of the princess, and they were very interested in visiting the headquarters of the Average Consortium. What do you think? Are you all in agreement?"

Rarity looked to her friends, who nodded enthusiastically. No one objected, except Rainbow Dash, who was still trapped by Applejack, shaking her head vigorously but to no avail.

"Yes, we’re completely in agreement," Rarity said without a hint of hesitation.

"Excellent, I’ll be expecting you then," Magi responded with a satisfied smile.

Applejack finally released Rainbow Dash. The rainbow-maned pegasus didn’t hesitate to scold them: "WHAT WERE YOU THINKING!? DIDN’T YOU HEAR EVERYTHING I SAID ABOUT HER?!"

"We understand perfectly, Rainbow Dash. But it’s not the first time we’ve dealt with merchants like her. No offense," Rarity added quickly, turning her gaze back to Magi.

"Don’t worry," Magi replied, casually sipping a drink from one of the seats.

"Rainbow, we’ve taken much bigger risks in the past. Have you forgotten?" Applejack asked firmly.

"But this is different! She’s not a monster or some strange threat trying to destroy Equestria. IT’S MY STUPID MISTAKE! You shouldn’t have to carry this too," Dash said, frustrated, as small tears began to well up in her eyes.

"Alright, alright, calm down, Dashi. It’s not that bad. We all make mistakes. Besides, it’s just a visit to a shady company where they might brainwash us," Pinkie Pie said, nonchalantly leaning on Dash. Behind them, Magi raised an eyebrow, intrigued.

"You can always count on us. And don’t forget about Twilight; she could probably help you with the legal side of things," Fluttershy added, moving to the other side of Dash.

"Right, she could help. Wait... Twilight! WE STILL HAVEN’T DRAWN WHO’S IN CHARGE OF TODAY’S SURPRISE!" Dash exclaimed, suddenly worried.

"Don’t worry about that, silly, I’ll give up my spot," Pinkie Pie said with a big grin, showing no sign of regret.

"Me too," Fluttershy added with a sweet smile.

"Girls... you..." Dash could no longer hold back her tears, and soon they all embraced in a group hug, just like so many times before.

Outside, the sun continued to shine brightly as the train sped through the vast prairie once again.

While the group of friends enjoyed their team hug, Magi watched them in silence, deep in thought. "Is this the magic of friendship I've heard so much about?" Something dark and deep within the executive pegasus began to stir. Finally, she stood up from her seat.

"Sorry to interrupt, but is it really alright for you to be so separated?" Magi said, now standing in the middle of the aisle.

Applejack and the others turned to look at her. Despite Magi maintaining a pleasant and understanding demeanor, there was a slight edge of irritation in her voice.

"What do you mean, darling?" Rarity asked, raising an eyebrow with curiosity.

"Girls, all of you make an incredible team and have achieved amazing things together. Many earth ponies, pegasi, and unicorns admire you all across Equestria. So, why don’t you stay a team and govern right alongside Princess Twilight's throne?"

The five friends exchanged glances. After several seconds of silence, it was Applejack who stepped forward and answered.

"Listen, Magi, it’s true that each one of us has great talent and that we've accomplished many incredible things with Twilight. But governing Equestria that way with her wouldn’t be right," Applejack stated firmly.

"Wouldn’t be right? How can that be?" Magi responded, almost indignantly.

"When we met Twilight, she was on a mission to learn about the magic of friendship in our home, Ponyville. From that moment, Twilight began learning many lessons about friendship from us. But we also learned from her. One of the first lessons she taught us was that everything has its place and its time. Of course, we would all love to spend more time with her, but if we did, over time we’d become a burden, and that would probably stop her from growing into the great princess she’s destined to be. We want the best for our friend. So, in this case, we step aside," Applejack concluded solemnly, as the rest of her friends nodded silently in agreement.

Magi looked at them in disbelief, unable to process what she had just heard.

"Besides, none of us would know how to behave properly as royalty..." Applejack added, when a slight clearing of the throat behind her interrupted.

"...Well, some of us would," Rarity said with a haughty air.

Laughter quickly filled the car as Rarity pretended to scold them. "But it’s true!"

Magi observed the group of friends laughing together, as if the conflict from moments ago had never existed.

"Really, I...," Magi began, still incredulous, but she quickly stopped herself. "...I still can’t understand it."

"It’s not that complicated. As they say, if you love something, let it go," Applejack responded eloquently.

"NEVER!" Magi replied abruptly, before quickly correcting herself awkwardly. "Uh... I mean, I’ve never really understood that saying. Letting go of what you love? Ha, ha... sounds kind of silly, doesn’t it? Ha, ha."

The sudden change in attitude didn’t go unnoticed. Applejack’s words had touched a sensitive nerve in Magi, who had unwittingly revealed her true nature.

Applejack and the other ponies looked at her curiously.

The executive pegasus stepped back nervously.

"Hey, are you alright?" Applejack asked, frowning.

"No! Well... yes, yes. I just remembered I have another meeting. Wow, it’s gotten late!" Magi replied hastily as she began packing up her presentation materials. Out of the corner of her eye, she observed the ponies, noticing the suspicious looks they were starting to direct at her.

This wasn’t going well. Things hadn’t turned out as she had expected. Her original plan was to divide them, and if that didn’t work, at least gain their trust. But now, she had achieved neither of her objectives, and her image was starting to falter. She needed to retreat and rethink her strategy immediately.

"Oh dear! I can’t find my travel brochures. Could someone open the windows? It’s getting a bit dark and I can’t see well," Magi said, feigning concern as she rummaged through her suitcase with hurried movements. In reality, she was calculating her escape, glancing quickly at the hatch in the ceiling of the car.

"The windows are already open," Pinkie Pie responded with a hint of confusion.

Magi, along with the others, realized that it was true.

It was strange. It was barely past noon, but outside, it was as dark as if night was about to fall.

Then, a sharp whistle from the train echoed through the car, startling everyone. An instant later, chaos broke out.

[hr]

Abruptly, the train heading to Canterlot came to a screeching halt.

With no time to react, and dragged by inertia, the six ponies were thrown toward one end of the car, crashing into one another in a tangled heap. The lights suddenly went out, and the deafening screech of the brakes filled the air for several seconds until, finally, the train came to a standstill.

In the darkened car, fear and confusion reigned among the passengers. Outside, the darkness was complete, as if night had suddenly fallen.

In the ponies’ car, the situation was no different.

"Girls, are you alright? Oh, my wing!"
"Can you get off me?"
"I can't feel my tail!"
"Muuu hu... I have... a... hoof... ugh... in my mouth!"
"Uhmmm uhmmmm uhmmmm."

Rainbow Dash was the first to react. She pushed whoever was on top of her off and, blindly, began searching for the emergency switch. Moments later, a faint red light filled the car, revealing the chaos.

As she had imagined, Fluttershy was on top of her. The yellow pegasus, dazed, slid over to one of the seats. Further back, the rest of her friends were tangled in a mess of limbs and disheveled manes.

"This is no time to rest, Fluttershy!" Rainbow Dash scolded, standing up. "Let’s help the rest, now!"

"Yes, yes... sorry," Fluttershy replied, shaking her head to clear her mind. With a little more clarity, she hurried to help Dash free the others.

Soon, they were all standing again.

"Cough, cough! Thank goodness!" Rarity exclaimed with a sigh of relief. She was the first to rise after removing Applejack’s left hat, which had ended up in her mouth.

"Thanks, Fluttershy. But... I still can’t feel my tail..." murmured Pinkie Pie as she staggered to her feet. Indeed, her characteristic fluffy tail had lost almost all of its volume.

Rainbow Dash, busy helping Applejack to her hooves, didn’t pay attention.

"What a crash! Are you all okay?" Applejack asked, recovering quickly. Despite having ended up at the back of the pile, she didn’t seem affected. She hadn’t even lost her hat. Ironically, Pinkie’s tail had cushioned part of the impact.

"I’m fine," Rainbow Dash replied as she glanced around the rest of the car. "Although... they don’t look too good."

Behind Applejack, the other ponies had gathered around Rarity, who had lit up her horn, casting a dim light around her immediate area. The emergency lights had failed at some point, leaving the rest of the car shrouded in eerie shadows.

"Don’t worry, Applejack. We’re just a little stunned from this terrible accident," Rarity commented, using her horn’s light to inspect her friends and the scattered luggage on the floor. Suddenly, she let out a muffled scream. "What is this mess?! And my suitcase?! My imported beauty products!"

"Okay, everyone’s fine. Now we need to..." Applejack tried to intervene, ignoring Rarity’s growing panic, but then someone else spoke.

"Wait... everyone?" Pinkie Pie asked, her expression suddenly alert. "Isn’t someone missing?"

The five ponies then realized that Magi wasn’t with them. After quickly scanning the area, Fluttershy was the first to notice. "Look at that," the frightened pegasus said, pointing with her helmet toward the far end of the car.

A huge yellow sphere had appeared between the seats, blocking the exit on that side.

Surprised by the unexpected discovery, the bewildered ponies exchanged glances. Dash and Applejack, however, were the first to take action. With just a few exchanged looks, they seemed to silently agree, and both began to move toward the mysterious object, followed by the others.

They slowly approached, noticing with each step more details of the abnormality before them. It was something too unusual; more than a sphere, it looked like a giant egg, so large that a pony could easily fit inside. Applejack, having gotten close enough, noticed a message written on its surface and began reading it aloud: "High-impact protection capsule - Average C, huh?" she said, clearly confused.

At that moment, as if deflating like a balloon, a whistle escaped from the giant egg, which began to collapse. Slowly, the shape of a pony emerged from the deflated shell. Then, one end tore open, and an irritated pegasus stepped out.

"Ugh! How disgusting! Those incompetent tech people. Cough! I told them to include air fresheners inside the capsule. Cough!" Magi complained heavily, moving away from the remains of the capsule, from which a foul smell of rotten eggs was emanating. "It doesn’t matter... What the heck was that?"

Magi exchanged glances with the other ponies. They were all visibly stunned. The executive pegasus had irritated eyes and an expression so furious that it overshadowed any trace of the pleasant and understanding demeanor she had shown just moments before. After staring at them for a few seconds, Magi quickly turned and then returned her gaze to them.

"What a relief! You’re all safe!" Magi exclaimed with a forced smile, trying to hide the evident irritation she felt.

Dash was the first to speak.

"Don’t bother trying to keep up the act, Magi. We don’t need that right now," the pegasus said seriously. Magi quickly scanned the others. The stern looks she received reflected that they were all on the same page as Rainbow Dash.

After hesitating for a few seconds, Magi sighed and adopted a serious, cold expression, much more natural for her. "Fine, what did I miss? What’s going on?"

No one answered. A creak came from the back door of the car, drawing everyone’s attention. Soon, the door was engulfed by a bright pink magic, from which the figure of a pony emerged. Barely visible due to the intense light, they soon realized that this wasn’t an ordinary pony.

The light faded, and before them stood an enigmatic, unfamiliar pony. The pony, with a severe gaze, had short pink hair the same color as their eyes, but divided by a thick brown fringe. They wore polished black alicorn armor that seemed to glow with an inner light. On the chest of their dark armor was the relief of a silver tree surrounded by six stars, with a bright pink gem embedded in their neck. It was a steed, no doubt, but appeared younger than any of the ponies present. With an imposing stride, the young steed advanced toward the speechless group of ponies.

"GREETINGS, BEARERS OF THE ELEMENTS OF HARMONY. PLEASE, FOLLOW ME TO WAIT FOR THE CONCLUSION OF YOUR DESTINIES," said Badwhiz Starheart in a voice that sent a chill down the spines of all the ponies, including Magi.
