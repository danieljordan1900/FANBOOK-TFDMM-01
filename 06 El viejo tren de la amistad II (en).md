In the train bound for Canterlot, within one of the cargo carriages stacked high with crates and bulky luggage, a young pony sat cloaked in oppressive darkness. His face, faintly illuminated by the dim light seeping through the hatch above, betrayed a nervous energy. He hadn’t slept the previous night, and it had been hours since he’d had anything to eat. Yet none of this was the true source of his unease. His spirit remained resilient, his mind sharp and alert.

It was, rather, his clarity—the unyielding awareness of his predicament—that fed the storm inside him.

The moment of his ultimate trial was drawing near.

Trying to steady his nerves, he reached for the bottle of cider his mentors had gifted him before he boarded the train. It was his first time tasting cider, and the fiery burn of the first sip made him cough dryly, the sound echoing in the stillness of the carriage. Despite the discomfort, he kept drinking, downing about a third of the bottle before setting it aside. Gradually, the warmth of the drink eased the trembling in his hooves, and his thoughts became more focused.

With a bit of time to spare, he switched on the music player he carried, slipped on the headphones, and let himself sink to the floor in an attempt to relax.

The headphones were so new that their box still rested nearby, untouched apart from the broken seal. Another gift he hadn’t asked for but couldn’t refuse. It was unlikely he’d ever get the chance to own something this sophisticated again in his lifetime.

Curious about the sleek gadget, he picked up the box and read the label softly: "Gamma Silente Headphones - Averages C."

[---]

"...and that's what happened," Rainbow Dash concluded confidently. In front of her, her friends listened intently.

"Wow! That was incredible! You fought a giant crocodile, saved Daring Do from being eaten by a swarm of ant-locusts, and restored peace to a kingdom of hippos. You're amazing, Dashie!" Pinkie Pie exclaimed, bouncing excitedly in her seat.

"Yeah, that's a pretty ‘incredible’ story, Rainbow," Applejack remarked, her tone dripping with skepticism as she cast a sidelong glance at Rarity.

"And after all that, Daring Do gave you the original draft of her latest book? My goodness..." Fluttershy murmured thoughtfully, her hooves fiddling with the saddlebag slung across her side.

"Exactly! That's exactly how it happened," Dash confirmed, radiating an almost defiant confidence.

The four ponies turned their attention to the pile of disheveled and battered documents Rainbow Dash had proudly placed on one of the seats moments earlier.

"We understand these documents are very valuable, darling. And since you've brought them to our little gathering today, I suppose this must be the big surprise you have planned for Twilight, right?" Rarity asked, narrowing her eyes.

"Of course!" Dash exclaimed with excitement. "Knowing her, she's probably read the published book ten times already. But I’m sure she’ll be blown away when she sees this."

Rainbow Dash had pictured this moment over and over. Her friends would bombard her with questions and praise for her brilliant idea, and she'd respond to each one enthusiastically. As long as she avoided mentioning that other dangerous matter, everything she’d gone through to get those documents would be worth it.

All I need is their approval... just that.

Keeping her emotions tightly guarded, Dash waited with a confident smile. But...

Nothing of the sort happened.

Instead, her friends exchanged silent glances, their expressions laced with concern.

"What’s wrong?" Dash asked, a chill of unease creeping over her as she noticed the lack of enthusiasm. "Don’t you think she’ll be impressed?"

She didn’t show it on her face, but inside, a growing fear was twisting her stomach into knots.

"Oh, she’ll definitely be surprised," Applejack replied in a calm yet firm tone. "It’s just that your story doesn’t explain what happened earlier."

A faint twitch in Dash's eyelid betrayed her nerves, though she didn’t seem to notice it herself.

"Explain what?" she shot back immediately, feigning innocence.

"Who was that suspicious pony we saw earlier?" Applejack asked seriously, her gaze unwavering.

"Oh, that? It’s nothing important," Dash replied with a casual shrug and a forced laugh. "Just a fan I met somewhere. She wants me to sign a contract to be her star model. Funny, right?"

Her words, deliberately simple, hardly convinced anyone. Applejack frowned, and Rarity raised a skeptical eyebrow.

"A fan?" Applejack pressed, her tone sharpening.

"You should probably talk to her. She shouldn’t be creeping on you like that. It'll just cause you more trouble and make you more stressed than you already are," Pinkie chimed in, pulling a muffin out of nowhere and taking a nonchalant bite.

The other ponies shot her brief, reproachful looks; they all knew Pinkie wasn’t exactly the best source of advice on boundaries, given her own history of similar behavior.

"Stressed? What are you talking about, Pinkie? I'm perfectly fine," Dash retorted, her tone a mix of exasperation and defiance.

"Pinkie’s right, darling. You look dreadful. Have you seen yourself in a mirror?" Rarity chimed in, her usual dramatic concern for appearances shining through.

Rainbow frowned, feeling a twinge of irritation. She rarely trusted Rarity’s opinions on her looks, considering them overly melodramatic. Still, the seed of doubt was planted, so she turned to the friend she knew would never lie to her.

"Fluttershy, do I really look that bad?" she asked, avoiding Applejack's piercing gaze.

"Well... you don’t look too bad, but when you first arrived, I was really worried. Actually, we all were," Fluttershy admitted softly as she pulled out a small mirror and offered it to Dash.

With some reluctance, Rainbow glanced at her reflection. Fluttershy wasn’t wrong. Her mane was more disheveled than usual, her eyes were slightly red, and faint dark circles lingered beneath them. She still thought she looked awesome—naturally—but she couldn’t deny she wasn’t at her best.

"Maybe you should go talk to your 'admirer' and clear things up," Applejack cut in firmly. "We’ve got a special day planned with Twilight, and it wouldn’t be fair to mess it up with all this drama."

Dash rolled her eyes with a groan, letting out an exaggerated sigh. "Pfft! You worry too much, Applejack! Everything’s fine!"

Just then, the cheerful chime of the train car bell interrupted the conversation. Moments later, a train attendant poked his head in, the lively chatter of young voices growing louder beyond the door.

"Excuse me, is Miss Rainbow Dash here? A group of foals is eager to meet her," the attendant announced kindly. The noise outside surged, accompanied by excited shouts and praises directed at the pegasus.

Rainbow Dash’s friends turned toward the commotion, but when they looked back to Dash... the spot where she had been standing was empty.

"Rainbow?" Applejack called, blinking as she scanned the car.

A few steps away, Dash’s silhouette was visible. Her head was sticking out of the window, and the rest of her body was poised in a suspiciously ready-to-jump stance.

"Ha, ha! Sure is warm today, huh?" Dash said with a nervous grin, slowly retreating back into the center of the car while doing her best to avoid her friends’ questioning stares.

[---]

The train car erupted into a deafening uproar of cheers and excited shouts.

"IT'S RAINBOW DASH!" "SHE'S AMAZING!" "YEAH!" cried the foals, practically vibrating with joy as they crowded around their idol. Her friends watched with amused smiles—except Applejack, who maintained a skeptical expression.

"Alright, I’ve got this," Dash said, visibly perking up. She stepped away from her friends and strode forward confidently. "Wow! I guess you all came here for an autograph, huh?"

"YEEEEESSS!" the young ponies neighed in unison, some bouncing up and down while others stomped their hooves in a frenzy of excitement.

The roar of cheers and the glimmering admiration in her fans’ eyes rekindled Rainbow Dash’s energy. With a flourish of her wings, she lifted into the air, striking her signature pose. Any trace of fatigue or unease melted away, as though the adoration itself had magically reinvigorated her.

"Alright, alright, calm down. Form a line and give me something to sign." Dash landed next to a seat and, as if she had rehearsed it, pulled a pen out from her mane. "Okay, who’s first?"

Without hesitation, the foals lined up in an orderly queue. First up was a filly sporting a pink hat and ribbon, holding what appeared to be a cookbook. Beaming, she handed it to Dash.

"Huh? Are you sure you want me to sign this? Fine by me." Dash quickly scribbled her name across the open page.

"YESSS! Of course! Your Blackberry Pie recipe tastes just like my grandma’s!" squealed the filly before bouncing out of the line.

"Uh... what?" Dash muttered, confused. Behind her, she could hear Pinkie Pie choking on a muffin, but decided to ignore it. "Alright… next!"

"Me! Me! Over here!" a blue-coated colt with white sneakers called, handing Dash a travel shoe catalog.

"Now this is more like it! Here you go." Dash swiftly signed the booklet.

"Awesome! Now my parents have to buy me the same sneakers you wear! Yesss!" the colt shouted, running off excitedly.

Behind Dash, her friends exchanged murmurs. She didn’t turn around, but her smile began to falter as an uncomfortable feeling crept over her. Something wasn’t adding up.

Everypony in that car knew perfectly well that Rainbow Dash didn’t wear sneakers.

"Okay, you!" she said, pointing a hoof at the next filly—a young pony with stickers plastered across her face. "Where do you want me to sign?"

"On my fashion magazine," the filly answered brightly.

"And that’s because…?" Dash asked, feeling a knot tighten in her stomach.

"Because I love your makeup! Your sparkles and stickers are fabulous! Yip!" the filly neighed enthusiastically.

Rainbow Dash nearly yanked the magazine from the filly's hooves. Flipping through it, her expression shifted to one of mild horror.

"Alright, here’s your autograph," she said briskly, scrawling her name and handing the magazine back. She then turned to the remaining line.

"THANK YOU FOR COMING, BUT THAT’S ALL FOR NOW!" she suddenly shouted.

A ripple of confusion swept through the foals, but before they could voice their disappointment, Dash raised a hoof and added:

"I’LL KEEP SIGNING AUTOGRAPHS WHEN WE GET TO THE NEXT STATION! I PROMISE! RAINBOW DASH’S WORD!"

Perhaps it was blind faith in her or simple politeness, but most of the foals complied, though a few visibly pouted. With the help of the train attendant, Rainbow Dash quickly ushered the young ponies out of the car.

Dash let out an exhausted sigh as she shut the door of the train car behind the last of the foals. One problem had been resolved, but now she felt a bigger one looming over her.

"Wow, Rainbow, I didn’t know you liked wearing sneakers," Pinkie Pie remarked, holding up a brochure one of the foals had dropped.

Before another second passed, Dash sprang into action with lightning speed. She snatched the brochure from Pinkie’s hooves and hastily scooped up all the others scattered on the floor, tossing them out one of the train’s windows.

“Whew! Those kids really need to take better care of where they leave their trash. Cleanliness is super important, don’t you think?” Dash said, breathless, as she slammed the window shut with a forced grin.

Her friends stared at her in baffled silence. While most exchanged uneasy glances, trying to brush off the incident, Applejack wasn’t about to let it go.

“That’s it! Rainbow Dash, what in tarnation are you hiding?” demanded the farm pony, her tone firm as she stepped closer to the pegasus.

“Hiding? Me? Hah! What could I possibly be hiding?” Dash replied, letting out a laugh that sounded more like a nervous hiccup.

“Ever since you got here, somethin’ just ain’t sittin’ right. And when somethin’ ain’t right, I can’t just keep my mouth shut. So I’m askin’ you one more time—WHAT ARE YOU HIDIN’, RAINBOW DASH?” Applejack’s voice rose as her emerald eyes bore into Dash’s.

“Whoa, whoa, calm down, Applejack! Everything’s fine. Nothing to worry about. Right, girls?” Dash’s eyes darted to her other friends, silently pleading for backup.

But all she got was silence.

The weight of her friends’ disapproving gazes bore down on her. Frustration bubbling up, Dash decided she’d had enough. Her tone turned sharp and defensive as she spoke:

“Y’know what? I just remembered I have something to pick up. I’m gonna head on ahead. See you all in Canterlot.”

“You—!” Applejack started, her voice tinged with indignation, but she was cut off by an unexpected voice.

“Leaving already, Rainbow Dash? I thought you’d want to spend more time with your friends,” a smooth, unfamiliar voice chimed in from the far end of the car.

Everypony turned to look. There, lounging comfortably and holding a drink in her hoof, sat none other than Magazine Doublereport herself.

[---]

The train's progress had slowed to a crawl. Out in the vast prairie, flocks of sheep leisurely crossed the tracks, oblivious to the frustration of the train engineers, whose schedule was already severely behind.

Meanwhile, the guest carriage was a hub of far more activity. A mysterious pegasus with a white coat and a red mane streaked with black had suddenly interrupted the gathering of friends. Rising to her hooves, the unfamiliar mare approached the ponies with a sly look and a radiant smile. Her confident demeanor was that of a seasoned city entrepreneur. And indeed, that’s precisely what she was. The yellow tie she wore, the office accessories peeking from her sleek saddlebags, and the overpowering fragrance she exuded made that abundantly clear.

Magazine Doublereport didn’t need an introduction; her presence spoke for itself—especially the corporate badge pinned to her chest, bearing a sophisticated "A" in red, black, and white.

Of course, as a businesspony, she had to introduce herself anyway. But far from finding it tedious, she relished these theatrics.

And in this moment, Magi—as she preferred to be called—was enjoying herself even more as she noticed the faint flicker of fear in Rainbow Dash’s eyes.

“Hello! So wonderful to meet you all! I’m Magazine Doublereport, owner and CEO of the Averages Consortium. Please, call me Magi. It’s an honor to meet the heroic and celebrated friends of Princess Twilight Sparkle,” Magi said in an enthusiastic burst that was almost a whinny.

One by one, Magi greeted Rarity, Pinkie Pie, and Fluttershy, handing out promotional brochures with a dazzling smile.

“Uh, you’re not the pony from a moment ago…” Applejack observed skeptically, her eyes narrowing.

“And you must be Applejack! So pleased to meet you!” Magi replied, grabbing Applejack’s right hoof and shaking it so vigorously that the farm pony stumbled to the side, visibly dizzy.

With the introductions complete, Magi addressed the group with her trademark confidence.

“Apologies for the interruption, but I need to borrow your friend Rainbow Dash for just a moment,” she announced, stepping closer to the pegasus. “Your friends are as amazing as you said they’d be, Dash. You really should’ve warned me you’d be meeting them—naughty, naughty! But no hard feelings. More importantly, I need you to sign some documents to include the Crystal Empire in the marketing campaign. The Dash Splash cleaning accessories are a hit! Great name, don’t you think? Dash…? Dash?”

Rainbow Dash didn’t respond. Her eyes were glued to the brochures her friends were holding.

Pinkie Pie was barely stifling a laugh as she stared at a pajama catalog featuring Rainbow Dash in bunny ears. Rarity, stunned, examined a fashion flyer where Dash modeled an elegant spring ensemble. Fluttershy, frozen—no, paralyzed—clutched a brochure for “friendly hunting,” complete with images of taxidermied animals.

Without warning, Rainbow Dash bolted straight out the nearest window, leaving her stunned friends behind.

“Great. There she goes again. Is she always like this?” Magi asked, her tone a mix of irritation and surprise.

“And who exactly did you say you were?” Applejack demanded, still trying to steady herself after the overly zealous handshake.

“Pardon me, Miss Magi,” Rarity interjected politely, stepping forward. “But what exactly is your connection to our friend Rainbow Dash?”

“I’m her legal representative and manager,” Magi replied nonchalantly, settling into a nearby seat.

“Rainbow Dash has a manager?” Pinkie asked, tilting her head in visible confusion.

The rest exchanged glances, equally bewildered by this unexpected revelation.

"I believe I've heard of the Averages Consortium before..." murmured Rarity thoughtfully. After a brief pause, she added with a more serious tone, "Miss Magi, this is truly surprising for all of us. Could you please explain a bit more about this situation?"

"Of course, Miss Rarity. You see, your friend Rainbow Dash recently signed a binding contract with the Averages Consortium, allowing us to use her name and likeness. Given her immense significance as a star client, I personally took on the responsibility of managing all legal matters related to her. It's a challenge, considering how 'hectic' her daily schedule tends to be. Still, she's a crucial investment in our vision to make her the newest and greatest celebrity in all of Equestria!" Magi explained with a triumphant smile, as if announcing the crowning achievement of her career.

When she finished, Rarity was utterly stunned, as were most of her friends.

Well, not all of them.

Applejack, who had maintained a neutral expression throughout the conversation, had already suspected what kind of news Magi might deliver. The phrase binding contract only confirmed her suspicions. She wasn’t an expert in legal matters like Twilight, but her granny had shared enough tales about such documents to know they rarely brought good news.

"So that's what she did..." Applejack murmured, piecing things together in her mind. Then, with a firm tone, she added, "So that's why you've been chasing after our friend, huh, Miss 'Magi'?"

Sensing the tension in Applejack's voice and anticipating where this was heading, Magi replied swiftly.

"I’d like to avoid any misunderstandings between us. Miss Rainbow Dash was given a fair deal and was fully informed of the terms of the document she signed with my organization. As such, I’m simply ensuring she fulfills her obligations under that agreement."

"Fulfills her obligations? And what does that mean, exactly?" Applejack shot back, her gaze unwavering.

Magi let out an almost imperceptible sigh. "Well, it's an unfortunately long explanation. I doubt you and your friends have the time—"

"We’ve got the time!" Applejack interrupted with firm determination. Her friends immediately nodded in agreement, making it clear they were ready to hear whatever Magi had to say.

Magi, however, wasn’t nearly as enthusiastic.

"Very well," Magi conceded with a slight bow of her head. Internally, she sighed again, resigning herself to delivering an explanation she would rather avoid. But she knew that to maintain control of the situation and steer it toward her objectives, she had no choice.

Without further ado, Magi began to explain. She detailed how, after meeting Rainbow Dash and convincing her to sign a binding contract at the Averages Consortium’s headquarters in Manehattan a few days prior, she and her team had started using Rainbow's likeness in advertising campaigns. She pointed out that while the brochures featured ponies who looked like Rainbow Dash, they weren’t actually her—just models meticulously styled to replicate her colors. Magi emphasized that Rainbow Dash had personally approved these strategies during a meeting, making it clear that everything had been handled professionally.

However, Magi left out a critical part of the story.

The truth was that all of it had been achieved through carefully crafted lies and manipulative tactics to secure Rainbow Dash's consent.

In reality, Magi wasn’t the virtuous pony her polished exterior suggested. Her business methods revolved around half-truths, subtle threats, and calculated deceit. And she executed it all with a radiant smile—a smile that wasn’t fake. Magi genuinely enjoyed the dark satisfaction of having power over others.

And if all else failed, Magi could always rely on more... persuasive methods.

As Magi finished her explanation, an unsettling sense of doubt lingered in the air between the friends.

"But why would Rainbow Dash want to become a commercial celebrity? She doesn’t chase that kind of fame," Fluttershy asked, her voice filled with genuine concern for her friend.

"It’s true that, at first, your friend Rainbow Dash showed no interest in my proposal," Magi replied calmly, taking a sip of her drink. "However, she changed her mind when I included an opportunity to acquire the original drafts of the latest Daring Do book in my offer. She seemed quite thrilled to get them. I believe she mentioned something about ‘winning a very special competition.’ Though, I’m not entirely sure what she meant by that..."

The four friends exchanged glances, then turned their attention to the pile of documents on one of the seats. Slowly, the pieces began to fall into place. Three years ago, the five of them had made a promise to surprise or celebrate Twilight on a day like this. They hadn’t specified what kind of celebration it would be—whether a party, a gift, or a thoughtful gesture—but they had made it clear that it would be a collaborative effort, without competition. Now, the recent events hinted that Rainbow Dash had decided to break that rule.

"This is truly shocking, Miss Magi. We’d like to know more about this delicate matter, if you don’t mind sparing us a little more of your time," Rarity declared, already sensing the depth of the trouble Rainbow Dash had gotten herself into.

"I don’t mind at all, Miss Rarity," Magi replied swiftly, her tone colder than before. "However, I don’t have much time to provide further explanations. I have a meeting with the board of directors at the Averages Consortium later today, and my star client, Rainbow Dash, must be present. I am obligated to bring her to our Manehattan offices, or your 'friend' could face severe legal consequences. I don’t want that to happen, and I imagine neither do you. So, if you’ll excuse me—"

"Don’t worry about that. I’ll go find her," Applejack interrupted abruptly.

"You know where she is?" Rarity asked in surprise, joined by Pinkie Pie’s exclamation of curiosity.

Applejack nodded firmly. Her confidence was enough to silence further questions from her friends. Magi, observing the gesture, narrowed her eyes slightly.

"Can you really bring her back?" Magi inquired, her tone skeptical.

"Sure can, and I don’t need you tagging along," Applejack stated plainly, leaving no room for negotiation.

Magi weighed the suggestion as she took another sip of her drink. Finally, she made her decision.

"Very well. I’ll trust you, Miss Applejack, and I’d appreciate it if you could bring her back. I’ll wait here... but no more than 20 minutes," Magi said, reluctantly agreeing, though her tone carried a hint of doubt.

"Won’t take that long. Be right back," Applejack assured her, adjusting her hat before quickly heading out through the back door of the carriage.

Her friends watched her leave, their concern evident. Each of them silently wondered what was going on with Rainbow Dash and fervently hoped Applejack would succeed in bringing her back.

Meanwhile, Magi...

"I have samples of the new Jumy Ginger Cookies. Anyone interested?" she offered with an air of casual indifference.

"Oooh, me!" Pinkie Pie exclaimed, enthusiastically raising her right hoof.
