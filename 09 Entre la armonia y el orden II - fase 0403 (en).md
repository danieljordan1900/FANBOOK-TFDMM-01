A small butterfly emerged from the last carriage of the train from Ponyville to Canterlot. It had been hiding until now, but after witnessing a blazing sandstorm, a dreadful winter frost, and finally feeling the true warmth of spring, it decided this was the perfect moment to come out of its hiding place.

It was like being in a dream. The hopeful little butterfly stepped outside, stretched its four delicate legs, shook its fluffy mane, and carefully unfurled its fragile antennae. A sweet breeze and a vivid fragrance welcomed it.

Anyone who got close enough to the little butterfly would understand that this was no ordinary butterfly. It was Fluttershy, transformed into a Breezie.

"What pure air! What a beautiful forest! This horrible nightmare is finally over!" Fluttershy exclaimed, thinking aloud with the innocence of a hundred children. Before her, the radiant beauty of the forest seemed to invite her to explore its paths. She could almost hear the murmurs of the kind creatures waiting to meet her.

Then, she remembered her friends.

"Oh, my goodness! What am I thinking? Twilight and the girls have surely already defeated those terrible villains and must be looking for me. I have to hurry and find them!" the Breezie Fluttershy exclaimed, convinced of what she needed to do. She quickly checked her mane.

Hidden beneath one of her braids was a beautiful butterfly-wing-shaped brooch with a pearl in the center. It was a gift she had received from none other than Queen Novo after saving the baby dolphins of Mount Aris.

The Breezie Fluttershy took the brooch and waved it. The pearl’s magic enveloped her, and in a delicate burst, she transformed back into a pegasus.

Before her own eyes, the magical world around her looked even more breathtaking. Enchanted, Fluttershy flapped her wings, spun gracefully in the air, and greeted the idyllic celestial forest around her with open hooves.

The forest felt her warm gesture and immediately responded… with fury and wrath.

Fluttershy had, in the past, suffered bullying from her classmates at the flight school—an experience she had considered horrible back then. However, what she felt now was beyond comparison. A pressure so intense, so crushing, that it was too much for her delicate and sensitive soul.

Under the enraged gaze of the hundreds of celestial trees, Fluttershy lost consciousness in midair and plummeted to the ground.

[---]

"So much fuss over a book? Keep your stupid book!" Magi exclaimed after rummaging through Fluttershy's saddlebag. She had hoped to find something of value, but once again, she was met with disappointment. Frustrated, she stuffed the book back into the bag and tossed it next to the bound Fluttershy, who was struggling to escape the janitor’s closet.

With a click, Magi shifted her appearance to that of Fluttershy.

"It's nothing personal, dear, but this is a matter of life and death. I hope you understand... See you later!" said the grinning impostor before shutting the closet door. Inside, the real Fluttershy tried to scream, but the gag prevented her from making a sound. Desperate, she kept struggling, being careful not to set off any of the many explosive boxes surrounding her.

"Help! Please, help me! Girls! What do I do?!" the pegasus pleaded helplessly, tears already streaming from her eyes. None of her attempts to free herself were working.

Her strength began to fade, crushed by the overwhelming despair within her.

"Twilight, please, come back! We need you!" Fluttershy prayed, resigning herself to defeat. If only Twilight were here, if only she had told them what to do…

Then, she remembered.

Twilight had told her what to do. Back in the infirmary, when Twilight had tended to her, she had asked Fluttershy to keep the magical brooch she had received from Queen Novo within reach. With it, if she were captured, she would have a chance to escape Vanilla by transforming into a Breezie.

With that small hope burning inside her, Fluttershy pressed her head against the closet wall, shifting her position to feel for the brooch hidden in one of her braids. After several failed attempts, she finally reached it.

A magic aura surrounded Fluttershy’s body, and in an instant—she was a Breezie!

"I have to warn my friends, fast!" Fluttershy exclaimed. Now free as a Breezie, she began searching for an exit. During her search, she found her saddlebag. Without thinking much about it, she used the brooch’s magic to shrink it down and secured it onto her tiny back.

An explosion erupted in the room, blasting her backward. Fluttershy flew toward a small opening that had formed in the door.

Vanilla was right there.

Fluttershy’s heart was pounding in her chest. Had her friends escaped in time? Had they been caught? What was she supposed to do now?

Fluttershy’s primal instincts kicked in. Only one thought remained in her mind: Run.

With the most agile flight a Breezie could manage in a confined space, Fluttershy, eyes squeezed shut, darted out of the closet and zipped between Vanilla’s legs. Guided by the air currents, as all Breezies were, she miraculously found her way outside.

A second explosion, far larger than the first, detonated behind her. The shockwave struck her from behind, sending her tumbling helplessly with the wind.

Fluttershy was swept away into the horizon, letting out a cry that no one heard.

[---]

"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!"

The horrifying memory of the explosion she had just lived through jolted the unfortunate Fluttershy awake. Disoriented, she looked around...

The celestial forest was watching her once more. This time, it would strike twice as hard.

Fluttershy lost consciousness again.

[---]

"Boom!"

The thunderous impact snapped Fluttershy back to reality.

The pegasus tilted her head, more catatonic than conscious. Unreal images floated around her, blurry and chaotic...

She had seen Twilight running between the trees... or was it Rainbow Dash? Then Vanilla appeared, suspended in the sky, clad in black armor that gleamed menacingly... and then he vanished again.

Fluttershy’s mind was a tangled whirlwind.

She tried to stand, but her body felt heavy, as if she were swimming in a pool of glowing liquid. Everything around her shimmered with an unreal glow, as if she were trapped in a strange dream.

"Ha, ha, ha, ha," Fluttershy laughed, without even understanding why. The celestial trees seemed to dance to an invisible melody, swaying with a hypnotic grace.

She hopped between them, her hooves barely touching the ground, while the bushes sang joyfully, an impossible symphony surrounding her.

Her mind sank deeper and deeper into unreality. It was like being in Discord’s house... Was he playing tricks on her?

"This isn't funny, Discord! If you're going to throw a surprise party, at least bring a good piano!" protested Fluttershy, her words vanishing into the air without meaning. "That way, we could dance together... one hoof forward... another back..."

Without direction or purpose, Fluttershy stumbled toward where she thought she had seen Twilight.

"La, la, la... Huh?"

Her cheerful hum stopped abruptly as she stepped into a forest clearing.

The sight before her stole her breath away.

There, someone who looked like Twilight was trapped, being brutally constricted by black chains that seemed alive. Spectral claws were pulling at something protruding from her body… something bright, ethereal, as if her very soul was being torn apart.

In front of this agony stood Vanilla. His wicked smile oozed dark satisfaction as he watched the pony’s torment.

Twilight’s agonizing screams filled the clearing, making Fluttershy's heart shrink in pain. Each cry was a direct blow to her soul, reaching the deepest part of her being.

Then… something deep within her ignited.

A latent force, hidden beneath her timid nature, awakened with fury. Her muscles tensed, and her fur bristled like never before. For an instant, she was no longer the Fluttershy who feared her own shadow. She was something else.

It was the call of destiny.

A neigh filled with determination shook the air.

Without a plan, without a strategy, but with all the power of her heart, Fluttershy charged straight at Vanilla.

[---]

Rainbow Dash never hesitated, not even in the most desperate moments. She always trusted in her own strength or that something—or someone—would change the situation in her favor. Although that faith sometimes led her to underestimate her own safety, and at other times had wavered over trivialities, when it came to her friends and the fate of Equestria, her loyalty remained unshakable until the very end.

A blink. That was all she needed.

Moments before, she had spotted Fluttershy emerging from the forest behind Balor. She couldn't help but think, "Why are you always late?"

When she saw Fluttershy charging at the enemy, her thoughts shifted: "That's it, Fluttershy! Go! Save Equestria!"

However, as she watched her completely miss and crash straight into a tree, her internal expression twisted: "Seriously? Don't do this to me now!"

But then, when she noticed Balor blinking, everything clicked. "Alright, that's it. It's over."

All of Rainbow Dash’s remaining magic concentrated into a single point.

With one final command to the fusion, Twilight-Dash, Rainbow Dash gave up her last reserves of strength. Something simple, direct, definitive: "Give it everything you've got."

At that moment, Rainbow Dash and Twilight separated from the fusion, clinging with all their might to the chains that bound Twilight-Dash. The ghostly grip crumbled like dust in the air, and Twilight’s soul, stretched but intact, returned to her body.

Freed from the control of both, Twilight-Dash—the fusion—had only a second of existence before fading. In that brief instant, she turned her entire being into pure light, hurling herself with all her might at the enemy before her.

Like a true rainbow bolt, the fusion tore through Balor’s defenses with overwhelming intensity. The impact was brutal, dragging her like a projectile through trees, rocks, and even the lake, never stopping for a second.

With each passing millisecond, Twilight-Dash’s existence disintegrated, dissolving into the air. And with every moment that passed, her opponent also began to fade.

Even as her consciousness slowly dimmed, Twilight-Dash smiled. She felt something unique, something glorious. She had fulfilled her purpose. Her friends were safe, and that was all that mattered.

Finally, everything disappeared in a beam of light.

[---]

The last thing Balor saw before closing her eyes was a blinding flash.

Then, she found herself once again within the golden orb adorning the ceiling of the war chamber.

The emblem of unity had fractured once more, her direct connection with Badwhiz was severed, and nearly all of her magic reserves were depleted.

She had failed.

Stepping out of the orb’s glow, without uttering a word, she took her seat among the rest of her comrades.

A deathly silence weighed upon them.

All had witnessed with their own eyes the true power of their opponent, as well as the princess’s schemes that had thwarted their efforts to capture her. None among them could accuse Balor of negligence. The battle had simply overwhelmed her.

Even so, the burden of defeat fell upon them all.

Among them, the one who carried the greatest bitterness was Ceridwen. He clenched his fists in fury. He could be blamed for failing to capture Fluttershy, but given the initial circumstances and how his success had been nearly assured, it would be difficult to make a case against him without implicating the others.

Mannah was not exempt either. He had continued with the operation fully aware that the princess would offer fierce resistance. As sub-leader, the greater organizational responsibility for this failure fell on him.

Morrigan, usually indifferent, looked noticeably tense. The soul-seizing spell that Balor had used was one she had taught her herself. If the princess had overcome that magic—one of their trump cards—what else could they rely on?

Perhaps the only one who could escape unscathed was Taranis. But upon witnessing Balor’s defeat, his spirit crumbled. There were other reasons as well.

Balor, lastly, had a distant and lifeless gaze. They had lost the sealing crystal cube—it had been hidden in Badwhiz’s mouth. Once the princess found his body, if anything remained of it, and discovered the crystal, it would only be a matter of time before she deciphered and unlocked it. She had estimated that this process would take at least three days. But after witnessing such skills in battle… was she really sure it wouldn’t happen sooner?

At this point, she was sure of nothing.

The silence stretched on for several more minutes.

Finally, Mannah stood up. He couldn’t allow his comrades to remain in a state of defeat. The battle was lost, but not the war.

"Ceridwen! Taranis! Take your weapons and come with me. We won’t give the princess a chance to regroup. Morrigan, stay here and monitor the enemy’s position. Activate all our secondary defenses," Mannah commanded, determined to return to the battlefield. He leapt down from his seat and magically equipped himself with a golden chainmail. A conch shell hung at his side.

Immediately, Ceridwen stood, spreading his wings as he prepared his golden staff. He also equipped himself with two rosaries of black pearls.

Morrigan, for her part, took Mannah’s place and began summoning scrolls with enchantments, while a larger scroll unrolled above her head, taking the shape of a strange halo of paper. This scroll was filled with unreadable arcane symbols.

However, Taranis remained in place, staring at the enchanted pond.

"Taranis! Do I need to repeat my orders?" Mannah barked angrily.

Taranis, in response, merely waved his hand, signaling for his comrades while pointing at the pond.

"Balor, is this part of the plan?" Taranis asked, alarmed.

Balor, whose gaze had been lost in thought, finally reacted. She turned back toward the pond.

"Huh?" she muttered in surprise, along with the rest of her comrades, who returned to see what Taranis was seeing.

It definitely wasn’t.

The images reflected in the enchanted pond showed something that neither Balor nor any of the Knights of Order had foreseen.

[---]

In the Celestial Forest, beside a straight path marked on the ground, three victorious friends advanced together.

"Hehe, well done, Fluttershy. That's the way to do it, buddy," cheered Rainbow Dash as she carried Fluttershy on her back.

"Thanks, Rainbow... but I feel better now. I can walk," replied Fluttershy, still somewhat disoriented.

"I don't think so. You’d better rest. You were exposed to too much magical stress," said Twilight, walking firmly ahead of her friends, though the deep bags under her eyes betrayed her exhaustion.

They had resumed their march shortly after Balor's defeat. At first, the euphoria of their improbable victory had filled them with energy, but that joy faded as they remembered that the fight was not yet over.

Twilight had brought them back to reality: the Knights of Order were still out there, unscathed, waiting for their moment.

"We must find the sealing crystal cube before the Knights of Order do. Then we'll take shelter and free our friends. After that..." Twilight stopped, exhausted, as she reminded the other ponies of the importance of their mission.

Twilight and Rainbow Dash had recovered relatively quickly after the battle, but Fluttershy was much more affected. She could barely speak. After being carried several meters by Rainbow Dash, she finally regained some lucidity and, in a fragmented manner, narrated what had happened.

Twilight had a thousand questions in mind, but time was not on their side.

Finding the sealing crystal was crucial. She still had some magic left to perform another fusion if necessary.

A cool breeze swept through the Celestial Forest, causing the light from the glowing leaves to fall upon them like shimmering rain.

Twilight could still feel the magic of the trees, but no longer the fury that had once animated them. She had deactivated the spell that linked them to nature, and now the forest remained calm. It no longer attacked them or Fluttershy.

The silence of the forest was strange. Twilight couldn't understand whether this tranquility was due to Balor's defeat or some other reason.

Suddenly, a heavy fatigue overcame Twilight. Her pony instincts urged her to stop, to lie down on the soft green grass under the shade of the mystical trees.

It was like a calling, a premonition impossible to ignore. The exhaustion weighed on her eyelids, and her hooves felt too heavy. But she couldn't stop. Time was her enemy!

However, the whispers of the forest were tempting. The wind briefly ruffled her mane, making it shine with the same glow as the celestial leaves.

"I need to rest..." Twilight murmured. Without waiting for a response from her friends, she stepped off the path and let herself collapse onto the lush grass. The warmth and life of the ground against her coat only intensified her weariness.

Looking around, she saw bushes of golden and scarlet tulips she had never noticed before, along with strange flowers that looked like multicolored dew clouds.

Everything was magical and supernatural, yet eerily empty.

Only the whisper of the wind through the vegetation could be heard. It was as if the forest were a desert hidden beneath its mystical radiance.

Suddenly, a long-forgotten hunger began to surface within her. The grass beneath her looked so clean and fresh that she could almost imagine herself eating it right then and there.

That was when she noticed something strange among the nearby grass. Intrigued, she got up and approached.

It was a saddlebag.

"Fluttershy's saddlebag? How did it get here?" Twilight exclaimed in surprise. She immediately recognized her friend's colorful saddlebag. Without hesitation, she picked it up.

At some point, during Fluttershy's erratic and delirious journey through the forest, the saddlebag had been lost. Later, caught in the chaos of battle, it had ended up beside the straight path left behind by Twilight-Dash's final assault on Balor.

Twilight's keen sense of smell caught a very familiar scent coming from Fluttershy's saddlebag. It was a scent she only associated with libraries. Her innate curiosity stirred, and Twilight opened Fluttershy's saddlebag to see its contents...

"Twilight, come quick, look!" Rainbow Dash's call interrupted Twilight, who, without thinking, slung the saddlebag over her back and hurried to catch up with Rainbow.

"What is it, Rainbow? Is it...?" Twilight fell silent beside her friend.

Not far away, next to the path, a little further ahead, lay a body.

It was Badwhiz.

The same pony who, hours ago, had threatened them and fought against them. Now he lay on the ground, his armor shattered, without his wings or horn. There was no sign of his dangerous gem either.

The three ponies stood in shock, including Fluttershy, who had climbed down from Rainbow Dash’s back.

"Didn't he turn to stone?! Didn't you say you hit him with a rainbow?!" Fluttershy asked, trembling, once again falling prey to her fears.

"He must have resisted the final attack at the last moment. Maybe he's tougher than we thought," Twilight reflected aloud as she observed the area where Twilight-Dash had vanished, leaving behind a noticeable crater.

"So, tough as oak, huh?" Rainbow Dash exclaimed in a tone that was both amused and challenging, exhaling forcefully through her nose. Without waiting for a response, she approached Badwhiz's body.

"Rainbow, be careful, it could be a trap," Twilight warned, a mix of concern and caution evident in her voice at her friend's reckless behavior.

"Ummhh," Rainbow Dash hesitated for a moment. Suddenly, without a word, she delivered a powerful kick to Badwhiz's stomach.

The wounded stallion rolled across the ground, letting out a pitiful groan.

"Well, looks like our show pony here is just taking a break after we kicked his friends' tails," Rainbow Dash commented, placing a hoof on Badwhiz's body to signal to her friends that he was no longer a threat.

Twilight and Fluttershy finally allowed themselves to breathe in relief.

"Come on, Fluttershy, I need help here. We're going to make this guy spill everything," Rainbow Dash ordered. Fluttershy, though reluctant at first, after a pressing second call, hurried to stand beside Rainbow Dash to help lift the defeated Badwhiz.

Twilight didn't want to be too harsh on the stallion, but she had no choice but to let Rainbow Dash handle it... she was exhausted.

"Alright, Mister Badwhiz. Now that we're still being 'nice,' could you please tell us where the crystal holding our friends is?" Rainbow Dash asked, readying her hooves in a threatening manner, as if about to crush apples.

"He... Rainbow, I think he’s..." Fluttershy gently interjected, trying to calm her friend's fury.

And in that moment, tragedy struck.

Badwhiz's head, which had been lolling unconscious, detached and rolled slowly to a stop in front of Twilight.

A cold stare, filled with hatred but devoid of darkness, locked eyes with the Princess of Friendship. It was the same look she had received when they first met at the train station.

Twilight’s exhausted mind took a moment to process what was happening. She was just as disturbed as her friends by what she saw. What was unfolding before their eyes could only mean one thing...

It was a trap.

Badwhiz’s head began to dissolve into a gray, deformed mass, like papier-mâché. The same thing happened to his body.

The ponies, unable to react in time, were ambushed. A powerful thunderbolt shot out from one of the trees, striking the ground at Twilight's hooves. The resulting explosion sent the princess flying through the air, crashing far from where she had stood.

Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash shielded themselves with their wings as they took the brunt of the explosion’s shockwave. Despite their efforts, they were hurled several meters away.

After tumbling across the ground, crashing into broken tree remains and surrounded by a thick cloud of dust, they finally came to a stop.

"Cough, cough—Fluttershy, are you okay?" Rainbow Dash called out through the dust.

"Ahhh, my head..." Fluttershy, dizzy, tried to stand.

The dust suddenly cleared, and Rainbow Dash froze.

"I'm here! Where's Twilight?" the worried pink-maned pegasus asked now that her vision was clear. However, Rainbow Dash didn’t answer.

"What's wrong, Rainbow?" Fluttershy asked, confused at her friend's reaction.

"Don’t do it," Rainbow Dash replied, fury in her voice.

"Don’t do what? Is something wrong?" Fluttershy questioned, unaware of the imminent danger.

"Don't you dare!" Rainbow Dash snapped, her anger growing.

Behind Fluttershy stood Badwhiz, holding the sealing crystal, aimed directly at her friend's neck.

Unaware of the situation, Fluttershy simply sat down and replied, "Okay."

That was it. Fluttershy vanished, absorbed into the crystal.

In her place, only Badwhiz remained, smirking, with a cracked pink gem around his neck.

Rainbow Dash had managed to keep her composure up until that moment. She had followed Twilight’s orders, she had been rational, she had been a good pony. But she had finally reached her limit.

"Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!" Rainbow Dash screamed, launching herself at her opponent. Filled with all the fury she could muster, with the last of her strength, she flew toward Badwhiz at full speed and, with a swift kick, sent the sealing crystal flying far from his left hoof. Then, with another strike, she aimed a kick at his head.

It wasn’t enough. Badwhiz’s magical shield activated at the last moment, withstanding the blow that would have knocked him unconscious.

The counterattack began.

Badwhiz fired a beam as thick as a tree, narrowly missing Rainbow Dash.

The pegasus, though her speed was greatly reduced from exhaustion, was undeterred and continued attacking Badwhiz’s barrier from different angles.

Badwhiz kept firing more bolts of lightning...

[---]

Twilight opened her eyes, feeling the thunder rumble nearby. The traces of a new battle unfolded before her. With palpable exhaustion, she got up and examined the battlefield.

In the distance, she saw Rainbow Dash facing Badwhiz, as if they were engaged in a chaotic dance. However, a stray bolt of lightning changed the rhythm of the battle and headed straight for Twilight. Reacting with difficulty, she ducked just in time. The massive bolt streaked through the air, missing its target and unleashing an explosion that obliterated an entire hill behind her.

The shocking scene left Twilight stunned. Her senses, now alert, set her mind into overdrive.

"The Starheart Gem had that kind of power? It shouldn't be like this!" she cried out in distress.

In her studies of ancient magical artifacts, she had learned that the Starheart Gem had the ability to counteract spells and absorb magic from the environment. However, the amount of magic it was now emanating was overwhelming, far exceeding the artifact's normal capabilities. A terrifying realization gripped Twilight.

"The Starheart Gem is overloaded. It could explode at any moment. But if that happens, then..." Her words trailed off, consumed by terror. They were in the middle of a magical forest with unknown powers. If the gem exploded, releasing the absorbed magic from the surroundings, the resulting explosion would be unimaginable.

"Rainbow Dash! No! Stop fighting, it's enough! Stop!" Twilight pleaded from a distance.

But her pleas came too late. The Starheart Gem on Badwhiz's neck had reached its limit. Cracks spread, and bolts of energy erupted in all directions. Rainbow Dash, horrified, halted her attack, but a lightning strike from Badwhiz hit her before she could move away.

At first, Badwhiz didn't seem to realize what was happening, but soon he understood. "What is this?!" he exclaimed, terrified. The gem on his chest unleashed lightning, and its blazing light intensified.

A massive crack formed, and suddenly, everything was light.

Sound and noise vanished.

The light engulfed everything.

First, Badwhiz's silhouette disappeared.

Then, Rainbow Dash's unconscious body lay on the ground.

Then, the path vanished.

From the ground, a sphere of pure energy began to grow, an explosion fueled by the magic of the forest.

The trees fell silent, their magic being absorbed.

The explosion continued expanding, forming a dome of light.

A terrifying vision of destruction.

The feeling of doom filled the air as the inevitable end approached.

[---]

When harmony and order fail...

Chaos and destruction take their place... then... darkness...

No one should ever go this far...

[---]

The expansion of the magical explosion swept everything in its path: stones, trees, fragments of the train, even the very essence of the wind. Twilight, powerless, clung to a large rock as the tide of energy advanced relentlessly.

Exhaustion consumed her. Her wings no longer responded, her legs barely held her weight, and her horn throbbed with irritation. She had no tears left for the friends she had lost. She only held onto Fluttershy's saddlebag, which she had found among the wreckage.

The explosion continued its march, but for Twilight, time seemed to stretch into eternity. Exhausted, she no longer wished to fight. With a weary sigh, she turned her back to the explosion and leaned alone against the large rock. She gazed at the horizon where, not long ago, she had fought alongside her friends.

It was a horrifying sight.

The beautiful forest that had so recently flourished was withering away rapidly. There was no trace of its sacred aura or its radiance; only decay and corruption remained. The trees crumbled into dust, while others exploded into a black, repulsive tar. The unnatural magic that had sustained them had dissipated, leaving them to vanish into the landscape.

A landscape devastated by the battle between her and Balor. Twilight was also responsible for the desolation. Her hooves were stained with the same violence.

The wind howled inside the barrier, sounding like wolves in a storm. The roar behind her grew louder. Twilight felt the ground tremble, but it wasn't just the ground; she herself was shaking.

Why had everything turned out this way? Could she have done something to prevent it? They were questions without answers. She only had the strength to question herself; there was nothing else she could do at that moment.

Among the whistling wind surrounding her and the remnants of the world falling apart behind her, Twilight felt something slipping at her side. It was a sealed book emerging from Fluttershy's saddlebag.

In a reaction more instinctive than conscious, Twilight took the book with silver edges and examined it. With a beautiful cover decorated with engravings of a forest and birds and insects in the corners, the title read: "World of Chaos, a real board game full of surprises and secrets..."

The roar intensified, the ground began to give way. Further down, a subtitle read: "For all my friends, especially for Twilight Sparkle, the smartest and most noble pony in all of Equestria... Created with love by Fluttershy and..."

She couldn't read any more. A light veiled her vision, and a warm sensation enveloped her. At last, Twilight was absorbed by the explosion and disappeared from this world.

[---]

Within the war chamber, the walls groaned, yielding to the unleashed fury. Jagged cracks began to tear through the integrity of the room. The enchanted pond, caught in a magical frenzy, boiled with intensity, reflecting the chaos and destruction unfolding within the great barrier.

The Knights of Order, fully aware of the gravity of the situation, had erected a defensive perimeter around Mannah, raising magical shields as a last line of protection. Fear was evident on their faces, marked by uncertainty and tension.

However, amidst the turmoil, one Knight remained unshaken. Seated outside the perimeter formed by her companions, Balor calmly observed the epicenter of the enchanted pond, now shrouded in the eerie glow of the uncontrollable explosion consuming every corner of the chamber. Her face barely reflected emotion, illuminated by the ominous radiance of the unfolding tragedy.

[---]

The wind persisted in its harrowing howl. The few trees left standing crumbled into dust in the maelstrom. All traces of water had vanished, and the land itself was disintegrating, slipping away toward an immaculate horizon. The explosion, fueled by the unleashed magical forces, grew at a frantic pace. It had already devoured a third of the space within the great barrier and showed no signs of slowing down.

The formidable barrier, which had once contained entities of incredible power, now trembled in its entirety. Its collapse was imminent, subjected to an uncontrollable force. The explosion had already taken over half of the remaining space.

Suddenly, the explosion's fury came to an abrupt halt. The walls of the luminous dome began to waver, and its pure white hue was soon streaked with a cascade of colors. Points of color danced throughout the dome, like glimmers on a spinning diamond. Multicolored rays illuminated the great barrier from within.

Slowly, the vibrant light faded, giving way to darkness. From within, the darkness devoured the light and its colors. In rapid succession, everything was engulfed in shadow. The lights dimmed, scattered like distant constellations in the sky.

At the explosion’s epicenter, the darkness seemed to consume itself. Without warning, all shadows retracted, collapsing back to their origin. No additional tremors or echoes followed. All was enveloped in profound silence, like a whisper in the wind.

The terrible explosion that had ravaged the interior of the great barrier vanished, as if it had never existed.

Nature took a deep, restorative breath.

[---]

The doors of the last car of the train from Ponyville to Canterlot finally opened. Upon reaching their destination, the Knights of Order emerged from the wrecked car, far from the dreadful explosion that had devastated the area just moments before.

Outside, a rain of ashes painted the desolate wasteland.

One by one, the knights took their positions, forming a perimeter. After confirming the area was secure, Sub-leader Mannah finally stepped out, accompanied by Balor.

Orders were promptly given, and the Knights of Order immediately set out to survey the surroundings.

Mannah remained near the train, awaiting the results of the search.

Balor, not far off, stood as his escort while casting detection spells.

Hours passed as the Knights of Order conducted five separate sweeps of the Great Barrier’s interior.

At last, they returned to their sub-leader and reported their findings.

There was no trace of the princess and her friends, nor of Badwhiz. However, they had found the sealing crystal cube completely intact and filled.

Balor was taken aback; this should not have been possible. The explosion had consumed everything inside the Great Barrier, leaving behind a massive crater. At the bottom of that crater, among the rubble, her comrades had discovered the sealing crystal that should have disintegrated along with everything else.

In disbelief, Balor took the crystal. After offering explanations and answering several questions about the discovery, she quickly returned to the train car to examine it in detail.

Balor's meticulous examination lasted two hours, and surprisingly, all results were consistent. The crystal was in perfect condition and contained the necessary magic to proceed with the second phase.

Reluctantly, Balor stepped out of the train car. Her comrades immediately gathered around, awaiting her verdict. Balor did not want to admit it, but duty compelled her.

"Operation 'Midnight Station' has concluded. The mission is complete," Balor proclaimed, her voice carrying with unwavering authority across the desolate landscape.

There were no celebrations, no cheers, no words of pride. None of them desired this victory.
