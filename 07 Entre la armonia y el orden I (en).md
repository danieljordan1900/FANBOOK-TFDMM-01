The noonday sun shone brightly over Canterlot, the majestic capital of Equestria. Along its white streets, cheerful crowds of ponies strolled, brimming with confidence and excitement. Every house and shop displayed festive decorations commemorating the grand occasion of the day.

It was the Festival of the Two Sisters. On a special day like this, there were few excuses not to enjoy it.

Under a clear sky, near one of the city’s scenic overlooks, a filly with a yellow mane enjoyed her ice cream carefree, a vibrant paper balloon gently floating beside her. The balloon, crafted by the filly and her friends as part of a gift exchange, tugged weakly at the knot tying it down, eager to break free.  

Little by little, the cord unraveled until the knot finally gave way, and the floating lantern escaped, rising gracefully into the deep blue sky.  

“No! My lantern!” the filly exclaimed too late, her eyes wide with dismay as she realized her gift was now out of reach.  

However, her concern was short-lived. In an unexpected flash, a purple-coated pegasus appeared from above. With agile and precise movements, she caught the lantern mid-flight and descended gracefully to return it to the young pony.  

“Yes! My lantern! Thank you so much, thank you, thank you…!” The filly trailed off, her voice filled with awe as she recognized the pony who had performed the kind gesture.  

Without waiting for further thanks, the kind alicorn lifted herself into the air once more with an elegant flight, her mane gently rippling around her majestic horn.  

Twilight Sparkle, wearing no attire to mark her as a princess and with no obligations interrupting her brief free time, rose to an altitude where she could overlook the entire city. Beneath her hooves, the shops and stalls were arranged as planned, security agents diligently carried out their duties, and the race stadium buzzed with ponies eager to witness the inaugural event about to begin. Everything was progressing smoothly—better than expected, even—as many had volunteered to guide visitors around the festival.  

“More families than in previous years… I’ll have to review the statistics later,” she mused, observing the long lines at the entertainment booths.  

With nothing else to supervise, Twilight began gliding in circles above the city, letting her gaze wander to familiar places: the library, the school of magic, and other cherished corners. In each of them, she saw ponies either enjoying themselves or contributing to the celebration, creating an atmosphere filled with joy and camaraderie.  

Twilight smiled, letting a hint of nostalgia accompany her flight. But it wasn’t a sad nostalgia; on the contrary, her heart shone as brightly as the noonday sun under a sky free of worries. In good spirits, she continued soaring through the air.  

Beneath her sprawled the city where she had grown up and studied for so many years. It was the place she had long considered her only home—a place filled with her family and countless cherished memories.  

Twilight paused mid-flight, her gaze drifting beyond Canterlot’s borders to the vast forest stretching toward the horizon. Her eyes settled on the nearby little town she knew all too well. It was there that her life had taken an unexpected turn. It was where she had left her old self behind to become an alicorn princess. Ponyville: the home of the best friends any pony could wish for, the very ones who had propelled her toward the role she now held.  

Her smile widened. Soon, those dear friends would come to visit her. They would spend the afternoon catching up on everything that had happened over the past year. Perhaps they might even surprise her, as they had done on other occasions.  

With her mind occupied imagining what kind of surprise it might be this time, Twilight dived swiftly toward the waterfalls cascading from the city, only to rise again like a beam of purple light toward one of the castle’s towers. The passersby on the streets watched in awe, marveling at the beautiful rainbow left in the wake of the princess’s fleeting flight through the sky.

In one of the storage rooms near the royal suite of the castle, Twilight was organizing kitchen and cleaning supplies. She had just finished washing a few commemorative plates from last year’s festival, a task that usually fell to the butlers or cleaning staff. However, they were all absent, as Twilight had ordered them to enjoy the day’s festivities. Only the guards remained on duty.

“Let’s see... These silverware sets aren’t complete. I need five more, but they don’t match the tone,” she muttered, frowning. Talking to herself wasn’t something she often did in her role as princess, but in that moment (being alone there), she allowed herself to simply be Twilight.

“I asked Spike to organize the boxes like the others...” she added, a hint of irritation in her voice as she noticed the disorder in front of her.

With a gentle flash of her magic, she lifted one of the stacked boxes, revealing another beneath it that seemed to be in poor condition. On its lid, handwritten text read: “Dishes, silverware, and others from the Castle of Friendship...”

“Yes! Perfect, this is exactly what I needed!” she exclaimed excitedly. The box, now floating in the air, opened with a flick of her magic. A complete set of cups, plates, and silverware emerged, levitating in perfect order. Twilight carefully inspected each piece, counting and verifying their condition. After a moment, she nodded in satisfaction.

“This will do nicely. The girls are going to love it,” she said with a smile, feeling a mix of pride and relief.

Suddenly, a swirl of magic formed in front of her, and a sealed scroll appeared in the air.

Twilight caught it with her magic and quickly read its contents. Her eyes widened in surprise: she hadn’t expected her guests to arrive so early. Wasting no time, she hurried out of the room, carrying the box she had just found with her.

In the throne room, Twilight waited impatiently for the arrival of her unexpected guests. The grand doors slowly opened, revealing two figures she knew all too well. Celestia and Luna, the former rulers of Equestria, entered with an elegant gait that reflected their royal demeanor. Though they had long since stepped down from the throne, the air of nobility they carried was unmistakable.

Twilight spread her wings and, with a gentle flap, approached them with a radiant smile.

“Celestia, Luna, it’s so good to have you back,” she exclaimed enthusiastically, embracing Celestia without hiding the joy she felt at reuniting with her mentor.

“Oh, Twilight, it really has been too long,” Celestia replied, allowing Twilight to lean affectionately against her side.

Luna, standing to the side, watched the scene with an amused smile. “Come now, Celestia, it’s only been five months since our last meeting,” she quipped, raising an eyebrow as if to temper the sentimentality of the moment.

“The spicy food contest in Fillydelphia doesn’t count as a proper meeting, Luna,” Celestia countered, gently pulling away from Twilight.

Twilight laughed, recalling the event. “I still can’t believe you entered that contest, Celestia. You made it all the way to the final rounds! I had no idea you could handle spicy food so well.”

Celestia glanced away, clearly uncomfortable at the memory. That contest had been the result of an impulsive bet with Luna, and if Twilight hadn’t unexpectedly appeared as a judge, she might have dropped out in the first round. The embarrassment of quitting in front of her former student had been greater than the burn on her tongue.

“There are still many ‘things’ you don’t know about us,” Luna interjected with a mischievous grin.

“Then you can tell me all about those ‘things’ as we take a tour around the castle,” Twilight suggested, already heading toward the throne room doors.

“There shouldn’t be any problem being honest in public, wouldn’t you agree, sister?” Luna teased, following after Twilight.

But Celestia didn’t move. Her expression, relaxed until that moment, grew somber.

“Twilight, has anypony come to you recently to ask about the Starheart Gem?” she asked gravely, her tone freezing Twilight mid-step.

“No, nopony has mentioned anything about it,” Twilight replied, turning back to Celestia with curiosity. “Isn’t that the famous unicorn gem that was lost a century ago?”

Twilight noticed the sadness reflected in her mentor’s eyes and felt a knot form in her stomach.

“Is something wrong?” Twilight asked, her voice filled with concern.

Celestia remained silent, as if debating whether to speak. Finally, Luna broke the tense moment.

“You see, Twilight, a few weeks ago, during one of our excursions, my sister had a dream in which she claimed to see the heir of the Starheart house...”

“It wasn’t a dream,” Celestia interjected, her serious gaze fixed on Luna.

Luna sighed, clearly skeptical. “Sister, we’ve discussed this. I reviewed their case myself, and there’s no evidence that any heir survived. Besides, you were exhausted from the trip that day. It’s far more likely that you mistook somepony else for them,” she said in a calm voice, trying to reassure Celestia.

Meanwhile, Twilight watched the melancholy etched on Celestia’s face, something she had rarely seen before.

At last, Celestia seemed to regain her composure and let out a deep sigh. “Forgive me, Twilight. I know this isn’t the most appropriate moment, but I need to speak with you in private.”

“Of course, I understand. We can use the special guest room in the east wing—it’s unoccupied,” Twilight offered empathetically.

Celestia and Luna nodded. Though inconvenient, Twilight couldn’t ignore the unease reflected in her former mentor’s eyes.

However, before they could leave the throne room, a soldier burst through the main doors, immediately capturing their attention.

“Is there an emergency?” Twilight asked firmly, recognizing the soldier as one of those assigned to report critical incidents.

The soldier bowed his head respectfully before responding: “Princess, I regret to inform you that the train from Ponyville to Canterlot has been attacked.”
