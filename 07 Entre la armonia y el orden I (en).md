Noon shone brightly over Canterlot, the majestic capital of Equestria. Through the white streets, throngs of ponies walked merrily, brimming with confidence and enthusiasm. In every house and store there was some commemorative ornament celebrating the great holiday of the day. 

This was the Festival of the Two Sisters. On a special occasion like this, there was little excuse not to enjoy.

Under a cloudless sky, near one of the city's overlooks, a yellow-haired filly was casually enjoying her ice cream, while a colorful paper balloon floated faintly tethered to her side. The balloon, crafted by the filly and her friends as part of a gift exchange, struggled against the weak knot that held it, eager to break free.

Gradually, the string unraveled until the knot finally gave way, and the flying lamp escaped, gracefully ascending into the deep blue sky.

“No, my lamp!” belatedly exclaimed the filly, her eyes full of dismay as she realized that her gift was already out of reach.

However, her concern was short-lived. In an unexpected flash, a purple-furred pegasus appeared from overhead. With nimble, precise movements, she caught the lamp on the fly and gently descended to return it to the little girl.

“Yes, my lamp! Thank you very much, thank you very much...!” The filly was speechless as she recognized the figure of the pony who had made that gesture to her.

Without waiting for further thanks, the kindly alicorn took to the air again with graceful flight, her mane billowing just barely around her majestic horn.

Twilight Sparkle, wearing no attire to distinguish her as a princess or duties to interrupt her brief free time, ascended until she reached an altitude from which she could survey the entire city. Beneath her hooves, the trade tents were neatly arranged as planned, the security officers were carrying out their duties, and the racing stadium was brimming with ponies eager to witness the inaugural event that was about to begin. Everything was proceeding as planned, even better, as many had volunteered to guide the visitors.

“More families than on previous occasions? I'll have to check the statistics later,” he thought, noting the long lines at the amusement rides.

With nothing else to oversee, Twilight began to glide in circles over the city, allowing her gaze to wander over places she knew well: the library, the magic school, and so many other familiar nooks and crannies. In each of them, she saw ponies having fun or collaborating in the celebration, creating an atmosphere full of joy and friendship.

Twilight smiled, letting a slight nostalgia accompany her flight. However, it was not a sad nostalgia; on the contrary, her heart shone like the midday sun under a sky clear of worries. In good spirits, she continued to soar through the firmament.

Below her stretched the city where she had grown up and studied for so many years. It was the place she had long considered her only home: the place where her family and so many cherished memories resided.

Twilight paused her flight, and her gaze drifted beyond the boundaries of Canterlot, toward the vast forest that stretched into the horizon. Her eyes were fixed on the small town nearby, one she knew all too well. There, his life had taken an unexpected turn. It was where she left her former self behind to become an alicorn princess. Ponyville: home to the best friends a pony could wish for, the very ones who had propelled her to the position she now held.

Her smile widened. Soon, those great friends would come to visit her. They would spend the afternoon chatting and catching up on everything that had happened over the past year. Perhaps they would even prepare a surprise for her, as they had done on other occasions.

With her mind busy imagining what it might be about this time, Twilight swooped down towards the waterfalls falling from the city, only to soar again, like a bolt of purple light, towards one of the castle's towers. Passersby in the streets, marveling, watched the beautiful rainbow that the princess left behind her in her fleeting flight across the sky.

In one of the cleaning rooms near the castle's royal suite, Twilight was organizing cooking and cleaning supplies. She had finished washing some commemorative dishes from last year's festival, a task that normally fell to the butlers or cleaning staff. However, all of them were absent, as Twilight had given the order for them to enjoy the holiday activities. Only the guards remained on duty.

“Let's see... This silverware is not complete. I need five more, but they're not the same shade,” she muttered as she frowned. Talking to herself was out of character for her role as princess, but at that moment (with her being there alone) she allowed herself to simply be Twilight.

“I asked Spike to organize the boxes like the others...” she added, somewhat annoyed, as she noticed the mess in front of her.

With a slight flash of her magic, she lifted one of the stacked boxes, revealing another one underneath that appeared to be in disrepair. On its lid, a handwritten text read, “Plates, silverware and others from the castle of friendship...”.

“Yes! Perfect, this is just what I needed!” she exclaimed excitedly. The box, now floating in the air, magically opened. A complete set of cups, plates and silverware emerged from inside, levitating in impeccable order. Twilight carefully inspected each piece, counting and checking their condition. After a moment, she nodded with satisfaction.

“This will suffice. The girls will love it,” she said with a smile, feeling a mixture of pride and relief.

Suddenly, a swirl of magic formed in front of her, and a sealed scroll appeared in mid-air.

Twilight caught it with her magic and read its contents quickly. Her eyes widened in surprise: she hadn't expected her guests to arrive so early. Without wasting any more time, she hurried out of the room, carrying the box she had just found with her.

In the throne room, Twilight eagerly awaited the arrival of her unexpected guests. The majestic doors slowly opened, revealing two figures she knew only too well. Celestia and Luna, the former rulers of Equestria, entered with an elegant stride that reflected their royal bearing, even though they had long since left the throne, the air of nobility they exuded was unmistakable.

Twilight spread her wings and, with a gentle flutter, approached them with a radiant smile.

“Celestia, Luna, it's so good to have you back,” she exclaimed enthusiastically, hugging Celestia unable to hide the joy she felt at being reunited with her mentor.

“Oh, Twilight, it really has been a long time,” Celestia replied, letting Twilight lean lovingly against her side.

Luna, off to the side, watched the scene with an amused smile. “Come on, Celestia, it's only been five months since our last meeting,” she commented, arching an eyebrow as she tried to soften the emotionality of the moment.

“The spicy eating contest in Yeguadelphia doesn't count as a proper encounter, Luna,” Celestia retorted, gently separating herself from Twilight.

Twilight laughed at the memory of that event. “I still can't believe you entered that contest, Celestia - and you made it all the way to the final rounds! I didn't know you were so tolerant of spice.”

Celestia averted her gaze, uncomfortable at the memory. That contest had been the result of an impulsive bet with Luna, and if Twilight hadn't shown up unexpectedly as a judge, she probably would have dropped out in the first round. The embarrassment of giving up so easily in front of her former student had been greater than the burning she felt on her tongue.

“There's still a lot of 'stuff' you don't know about us,” Luna interjected with a mischievous grin.

“Then you could tell me those 'things' while we take a tour of the castle,” Twilight suggested, already moving toward the doors of the hall.

“There shouldn't be a problem with being publicly honest, don't you think, sister?” joked Luna as she followed Twilight.

Celestia, however, did not move. Her expression, until that moment relaxed, turned somber.

“Twilight, have any ponies recently come to consult you about the Starheart gem?” she asked in a serious tone that stopped Twilight in her tracks.

“No, no pony has mentioned anything about it,” Twilight replied, turning curiously to Celestia. “Isn't that the famous unicorn gem that was lost a century ago?”

The alicorn saw the sadness reflected in her mentor's eyes and felt a knot in her stomach.

“Is something wrong?” asked Twilight with concern.

Celestia remained silent, as if debating internally whether she should speak. Finally, Luna broke the awkward moment.

“You see, Twilight, a few weeks ago, during one of our excursions, my sister had a dream in which she claimed to have seen the heir to House Starheart...”

“It wasn't a dream,” Celestia interrupted with a serious look at Luna.

Luna sighed, evidently skeptical. “Sister, we've been over this. I reviewed your case myself and there is no evidence that you survived. Besides, you were exhausted from the trip that day. It's more likely that you mistook him for some other pony,” she said in a calm voice, trying to reassure Celestia.

Meanwhile, Twilight watched the melancholy on Celestia's face, something she had rarely witnessed.

Finally, Celestia seemed to come to her senses and sighed deeply. “Forgive me, Twilight. I know this isn't the most appropriate time, but I need to speak with you privately.”

“Sure, I understand. We can use the special guest room in the east wing, it's free,” Twilight offered in an understanding tone.

Celestia and Luna nodded. Although unwelcome, Twilight could not ignore the uneasiness reflected in her former mentor's eyes.

Before they could leave the room, however, a soldier quickly burst through the main doors, drawing their immediate attention.

“Has an emergency happened?” asked Twilight firmly, recognizing the soldier as one of those in charge of reporting serious incidents.

The soldier bowed his head respectfully before replying, “Princess, I regret to report that the train from Ponyville to Canterlot has been attacked.”
