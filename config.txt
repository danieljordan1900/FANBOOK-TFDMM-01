What I'm looking for: currently the fanfic is finished, I would like a critique of the narrative flow in general. Since it is mystery and adventure, I hope to be able to meet those expectations.

What I can offer: I like science fiction and fantasy, I can read that without problems and if you have a story of less than 20,000 words. I will read it
