To all inhabitants of Cunabula,

Through this public declaration, we accuse Equestria and its allied nations of being complicit in a conspiracy to surrender the world to the Dark Lord Kal-Arth. This action is being carried out for their own benefit and at the expense of the peace and order of the other kingdoms that inhabit it.

The Knights of Order, in their brave mission to preserve peace and stability in our land, face an extremely difficult task: stopping this conspiracy that threatens all races of our world.

This accusation is made public to highlight the gravity of the situation and the urgent need to take immediate action to counter this threat. The stability and peaceful coexistence among the races of our world are at stake.

Balor finished reading a scroll that had arrived in her mailbox in Cunabula.

"That's a solid accusation," Mannah exclaimed proudly.

"Is it really necessary to deceive the people with this?" added Ceridwen, visibly upset.

"There is evidence, and there are doubts. It’s an accusation that can be sustained," Morrigan responded eloquently, shrugging.

"It's not deception; it's a narrative that must be verified. And it will be," Mannah retorted, shooting a piercing glare at her companion.

"In any case, the arguments to justify the actions that will be taken during the second phase of the plan are already on the table. If the leaders of the other nations refuse to be intervened—and they will—then we have a free pass to act in defense of peace and order," Balor replied.

After hearing Balor's response, Ceridwen looked as though she were chewing on a bitter worm.

With no further protests, Mannah decided to continue.

"Alright… all that remains is to send the report on what happened during the battle against the princess. I trust your contact will keep it hidden until we return," Mannah said, casting a wary glance at Balor.

"I have full confidence in him. He already received my orders. If we don’t return to Cunabula before midnight tonight, he will deliver everything directly to your brother. The council will take care of the rest," Balor replied confidently.

In the midst of the conversation, another voice was heard.

"Um, Sub-leader Mannah, may I ask something?" Taranis suddenly inquired, drawing the group's attention.

Balor and Mannah exchanged looks, but Balor quickly averted her gaze. Mannah was the one to respond: "What is it, Taranis?"

The ophiotaur swallowed hard and continued, "How do you plan to explain Badwhiz Starheart’s involvement at the end of the battle against the princess and her allies?"

His expression was so serious that it put the rest of the group on alert.

A cold silence settled over the hilltop where they stood.

"That’s a good question, Taranis," Balor thought to herself as she reflected on the situation.

After declaring the operation complete, a vote had been held at Balor’s request to determine who was willing to proceed with the next phase of the plan. Everyone agreed—except Balor. For that reason, she no longer felt the need to argue with Mannah about what had transpired in the battle and the results obtained. She would simply complete the remaining administrative steps.

"Badwhiz..." That was the name on everyone's mind. It was a delicate matter.

The "Midnight Station" operation, forcibly proposed by Balor and supported by her companions the previous night, was meant to reaffirm the power of the Knights of Order and justify their absence from the kingdom of Cunabula by facing an extremely difficult enemy. Designed to be more of a process than a decisive action, it involved trapping the princess and forcing her to fight against various minions under the knights' control. Wave after wave of enemies would gradually wear her down until she reached a point of surrender. Then, the Knights of Order would emerge from hiding, defeat her, and force her to admit guilt for activating the Trees of Harmony and the terrible consequences of those actions. Afterward, her magic would be confiscated, and she would be taken as a prisoner to Cunabula, where she would be tried for her crimes and imprisoned forever.

Of course, this plan was overly optimistic—a waking dream. Balor was well aware of the risks and did not agree with the changes that Mannah and the others had made to the original plan. However, given the princess’s history of avoiding combat, there was a chance this scenario could be possible. In the worst case, they had the Blazon of Unity as the ultimate, impassable barrier the princess could never overcome.

But in the end, the situation spiraled completely out of control.

The princess’s response to the trap was overwhelming. Despite having stationed the fearsome Gallodragon Titanicus as the guardian of their base of operations within the hijacked train, the princess easily defeated the beast that was supposed to be the strongest minion in their carefully prepared scenario. Given the grave threat this posed to the mission, they decided to use the Sealing Crystal Cube and the Direct Possession Crystal on the undercover agent, Badwhiz.

Badwhiz had originally been meant to act as a hidden wildcard on the battlefield, limited to observing and collecting samples of any changes that occurred. In other words, he was merely another tool in the plan.

In the end, Badwhiz—a simple earth pony from Equestria—ended up taking an active role in the conflict and sacrificing himself for Cunabula, despite being a foreigner. No trace of him remained. No trace of the princess and her allies remained either, although some of her companions were inside the Sealing Crystal Cube. However, none of them were significant enough for a public trial, which had been a secondary objective of the operation at Mannah’s request.

Balor thought to herself, "Too many mistakes were made. What do you have to say about this, Grand Sub-leader Mannah?"

Mannah had remained silent for a long time, staring into the horizon, until he finally turned to look at his companions.

"He is a hero. A full-fledged member of the knightly brotherhood. With his own life, he has proven his loyalty to our cause and to Cunabula," the sub-leader of the Knights of Order stated solemnly.

"He’s a foreigner!" Ceridwen exclaimed indignantly.

Balor, who was well aware of Ceridwen’s aversion to ponies, immediately thought, "And a pony..."

"He is the first in a long time. The recent changes in our nation compel us to consider other options to ensure the peace of our kingdom. I trust that in the future, there will be more individuals like Knight Badwhiz, willing to sacrifice themselves for our homeland," Mannah explained.

"The knightly brotherhood will never accept him!" Ceridwen shot back. Behind her, Taranis watched with a furrowed brow.

"We're straying from the topic... Does the boy’s involvement really strengthen our position of 'victory'?" Morrigan asked inquisitively.

"It didn’t go as we wanted. I’m aware of that. However, this battle was not just about the clash of our weapons, but also of our ideals. Knight Badwhiz, being of the same race as the Princess of Friendship, abandoned the weak precepts of his people and wholeheartedly embraced ours. He sacrificed himself just as any of us would have to achieve victory. It is undeniable proof of heroism that demonstrates the superiority of Cunabula’s principles over those of other nations," Mannah declared, his tentacles swaying with passion.

Balor stifled a laugh, though she would have liked to let it out. She had seen the recordings, and it was quite obvious that Badwhiz had accidentally overloaded his gem. This was no heroic act, but rather an incidental sacrifice.

Looking at her companions, she noticed mixed expressions on their faces.

"I don’t need to read minds to know what they’re thinking... 'politicians'," Balor shook her head internally.

Finally, Balor decided to speak.

"Sub-leader Mannah, since you have such a clear opinion on what happened, may I trust you to add these thoughts to the report I will send to Cunabula?" Balor asked, showing him a memory crystal.

Mannah briefly darkened his skin at that moment, though he quickly masked it.

"There’s no need for a memory crystal. A letter addressed to the council will suffice," Mannah responded, conjuring a scroll.

After a few minutes of writing, he handed the letter to Balor without further delay, and it was sealed.

"A memory crystal holds more weight in a trial than a written letter, which could be forged. How convenient..." Balor murmured internally.
