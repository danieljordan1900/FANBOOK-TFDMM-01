On the blessed island of Cunabula, at sunset on the Day of the Sun’s Purification, the celebration was in full swing. This date, the most important of the year, was celebrated by every inhabitant of the kingdom, who, regardless of race, status, or age, took part in one or several of the activities held throughout the day.

This ancient ritual, the Day of the Sun’s Purification, was closely tied to the summer solstice and stood as a powerful demonstration of each individual’s love and respect for their nation. It was also a unique opportunity for spiritual renewal and the strengthening of bonds among participants in this solemn occasion.

Encompassing this latter aspect, the Grand Procession, organized by the Temple Brotherhood, stood out as the most prominent event among all the day’s activities. Traversing the entire island, the Great Patriarch and the temple’s chief priests traveled from region to region, purifying the land from any magical corruption. Accompanied by musicians and crowds of followers, this marathon of faith, from dawn until dusk, vividly embodied the wholesome spirit of the nation.

Beyond this grand event, there were other activities that could be undertaken that day, though their significance and importance varied among the groups of people who carried them out. Such was the case with the Purification Bonfire, the Leap of Faith, the Lunar Walk, among others.

However, apart from all the festivity filling the air that evening, an unsuspected figure watched the celebration from afar.

From one of the viewpoints atop the island’s tallest mountain, this small and peculiar figure, barely visible, observed the ceremony unfolding beneath it.

With the lower half of a lion and the upper half of a pony, it was a native creature of the island: a "leopony."

More precisely, a young leopony.

Belonging to one of the six primary races inhabiting the island of Cunabula, “leoponies” formed a diverse species, spread across all social levels within the feudal government that ruled the kingdom. Without clear leadership within their own castes, they held a slight majority among the members of the citizen security forces and the army.

Despite his stern expression and martial bearing, the young leopony watching from the viewpoint did not belong to any of those groups.

He belonged to one even more important.

He was an apprentice in the Brotherhood of Chivalry, the elite group responsible for ensuring the security and prosperity of Cunabula. Trained in magic and strategy, the members of the Brotherhood of Chivalry held, without exception, the most significant positions within the island’s government, rising to become generals, royal advisors, and high judges. Being chosen for this order was an honor across all social levels.

And it could be no other way, as those chosen for the Brotherhood of Chivalry also had the opportunity to attain the highest title in the kingdom: to be called "Knights of the Order," the greatest mark of virtue for a member of each of the six races that inhabited the island.

Many children (and even adults) dreamed of belonging to this elite among elites.

However, the young leopony, motionless before the view beneath him, was neither dreaming, nor was he on a special mission for his select group, much less privately enjoying the joy of the day.

He was genuinely worried.

"How can they be celebrating in the middle of the crisis we’re in?!" the young leopony shouted internally, his face twisted in a bitter expression.

The cause of his distress lay behind him—or rather, in what wasn’t behind him.

There, atop the highest peak, stood the Sacred Temple of Cunabula, glowing with an otherworldly brilliance. Inside, the kingdom’s most powerful magic was kept: the magic of the Tree of Harmony. On this day, the temple was protected by a magical blessing, making it impenetrable and enhancing the power of all the island’s inhabitants. Its radiance reflected the people’s faith in their nation and their patriotism, which, in turn, fueled the magical veil that concealed and protected all of Cunabula from the outside world.

Of course, such an important place was not without guards. The young leopony and everyone in the kingdom knew that on this sacred day, the temple was guarded by the leaders of the Brotherhood of Chivalry. Yet, at that moment, the renowned leaders, the "Knights of the Order," were not there.

This was an unprecedented event in the past thousand years, and as one of the Brotherhood's most loyal members, the young leopony found this deeply unsettling.

Even so, it seemed that no one else cared. The celebration continued as if everything were fine. The Great Patriarch, leader of the Temple Brotherhood and temporarily also of the Brotherhood of Chivalry, had made no mention of it in his midday speech. Concerned, the young leopony had sent a letter requesting additional security, but all he received in response was an invitation to join the Grand Procession, along with a suggestion to spend the day with family and friends.

Of course, he did not accept that answer.

With few other options available, he invited his fellow members of the Brotherhood of Chivalry to join him in a vigil for the kingdom. A vigil that would include the Purification Fast, a trial reserved only for the most devout, which involved abstaining from food for the entire day to purify the spirit and increase magical power.

That didn’t work either. No one came.

The young leopony found himself alone, abandoned by his companions and accompanied only by the uncomfortable presence of his own solitude.

Or perhaps, he wasn’t entirely alone: next to him rested a basket of fruit.

Looking at the basket, he thought of his friend Dana, daughter of the current king and acolyte-in-training of the Temple Brotherhood. Dana herself had left the basket for him before the purification ceremony began. Despite the difference in their positions, they got along well and had shared good times in the initiates’ school. Although they hadn’t seen each other much lately, she knew him well enough to guess that he would attempt the fast and vigil. Taking all of this into account—had Dana left the basket to test his faith, or simply because she thought of him?

The young leopony closed his eyes, staying resolute. He wouldn’t let any tears fall. After a moment of sincere melancholy, he looked back at the basket by his feet. The shine of the ripe fruits and their sweet aroma filled his senses. His stomach growled.

He quickly recalled the teachings of his leader and mentor, the Great Patriarch: "Cleanse your mind, cleanse your spirit of this world’s temptations." Yet his stomach continued to rumble.

"I swear, Dana! When this vigil is over, I’ll savor every last drop of nectar from this blessed gift," the young leopony promised fervently, bowing his head in resignation.

Suddenly, as the young leopony drifted in his thoughts, an unfamiliar scent reached his nose.

Something wasn’t right.

Alarmed, he turned his head toward the empty path he had been guarding and spotted a hooded figure approaching the temple.

“Halt!” roared the leopony, his firm tone resonating through the air.

The hooded figure took a few more steps before stopping.

The leopony watched cautiously. Although the figure didn’t appear hostile, his instincts told him not to lower his guard. Under the afternoon sun, the stranger’s shadow stretched across the ground like a blade, only heightening the leopony's unease.

“Reveal yourself immediately! Concealment is forbidden in this Sacred Temple,” the leopony proclaimed, trying to keep a respectful tone. He’d already had trouble in the past with his superiors for “striking first and asking questions later.”

But the hooded figure remained silent, watching him without a response.

The lack of reply only deepened the leopony's worry. His mind raced: Where did this individual come from? Teleportation and invisibility are forbidden here. Could it be someone important from the "Council"? As he continued to analyze, a stab of pain in his head reminded him that fasting today had been a terrible idea.

Then, the stranger broke the silence.

“Greetings, cub. I’ve come to see the ‘Great Patriarch.’ He’s an acquaintance of mine, so, could you summon him immediately?” said a soft, musical voice—strangely enchanting. He had never heard a voice like that among the "Council" members or anywhere else in the kingdom. This could only mean one thing...

She was an outsider. An enemy! Here? Had the time finally come to prove his worth? Could he... fight?

Decisive now, his thoughts gathered. He exhaled deeply, casting away his remaining doubts, and fixed a fierce gaze on the stranger.

“No acquaintance of the ‘Great Patriarch’ would arrive here like a thief. Nor was your arrival announced. I’ll give you one chance: leave now and leave us in peace!” declared the leopony with all the firmness he could muster, bracing himself for combat.

“Well, so this is what we have... You don’t even ask my name?... Very well, I’ll be on my way,” the hooded figure replied with an infuriating calm. Unfazed, she continued forward.

“How arrogant... Try this!” thought the leopony as he launched his first attack.

Three large rocks rose from the sides of the path and shot toward the hooded figure. It was an impressive feat for someone as young as him, but thanks to the temple's blessing and his fast that day, he’d gathered enough magic to pull it off.

However, none of the rocks hit their target.

Instead, the three rocks began to orbit around the hooded figure, who seemed utterly indifferent to the attack. After a moment, the rocks returned to their original positions.

The leopony stood in shock, unable to believe what he had just witnessed.

“Uhmm... now it’s my turn,” the hooded figure announced.

A sudden heat spread through the leopony’s body, and a second later, everything went dark.

[---]

His head ached. He felt his body swaying in emptiness, as if someone were carrying him. Everything was hazy. Voices echoed nearby.

Had he died? The voices grew clearer in his mind. They were moving.

“…you shouldn’t worry so much, my great lord. Activating another tree would surely solve your personnel problem.” It was that same musical voice he’d heard before.

“Cunabula has the situation under control,” replied the "Great Patriarch."

A chill ran through the leopony’s body as he recognized the Great Patriarch’s voice. But… where was he? It felt as though a veil covered his face, and everything was dark. He couldn’t move his numb body. Then he realized it was the Great Patriarch carrying him.

“If you say so,” continued the musical voice, her words laced with a hint of disrespect. “By the way, who is this ‘cub’?”

“He is the future king of Cunabula,” answered the Great Patriarch.

“Really? Your ‘standards’ have lowered… but he’s stubborn, at least meeting the minimum required to be king, right?”

The Great Patriarch didn’t reply. Had he noticed that Danu was listening? Wait… king?

The atmosphere seemed to shift. The leopony felt himself beginning to fade again.

“Are you seriously not going to tell me his name?” asked the musical voice once more.

“His name is ‘Danu,’” the Great Patriarch declared firmly.

Upon hearing those words, Danu lost consciousness once again.
