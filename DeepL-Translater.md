On the train bound for Canterlot, inside one of the freight cars, among stacked boxes and bulky luggage, a young pony sat, enveloped in oppressive darkness. His face, barely illuminated by the faint light filtering from the roof hatch, reflected nervousness. He had not slept the night before and had not eaten for hours. However, none of this was the real cause of the restlessness that gripped him. His spirit remained strong, his mind clear and alert.

It was, rather, his lucidity (which allowed him to understand his situation with cruel clarity), that was the real source of his anguish.

The moment of his final test was approaching.

Trying to calm his nerves, he took the bottle of cider that his teachers had given him as a gift before boarding the train. It was the first time he had ever tasted cider, and at the first sip, the burning in his throat brought out a dry cough that echoed in the silence of the carriage. Despite the discomfort, he continued to drink, consuming about a third of the bottle before setting it aside. Gradually, the warmth of the drink managed to dispel the tremors in his paws, and his mind cleared further.

With some time to spare, he turned on the music player he had with him, put on the headphones and, somewhat more relaxed, plopped down on the floor.

The headphones were so new that the box still rested to one side, untouched except for the broken seal. Another gift he hadn't asked for, but couldn't refuse either. He would probably never have another opportunity to use something so sophisticated in his life.

Intrigued by that modern gadget, he picked up the box and read quietly, “Silent Gamma Headphones - Averages C.”

“...And that's what happened,” Rainbow Dash concluded confidently. In front of her, her friends listened intently.

“Wow! That was awesome. You fought a giant crocodile, saved Daring Do from being eaten by a swarm of ant-lobsters, and restored peace to a kingdom of hippos. You're amazing, Dashi!” exclaimed Pinkie Pie excitedly jumping in her seat.

“Yes, it really is an 'amazing' story, Rainbow,” commented Applejack, her tone laden with skepticism, as she glanced sideways at Rarity.

“And after all that, Daring Do handed you the original draft of his latest book. Wow...” said Fluttershy quietly, thoughtfully, as her hooves fiddled with the saddlebag at her side.

“Exactly, that's how it went. Definitely,” Dash confirmed, radiating an almost defiant assurance.

The four ponies looked at the pile of messy, battered documents that Rainbow Dash had proudly placed on one of the seats moments before.

“We understand that these documents are very valuable, my dear. And since you brought them to our meeting today, I suppose this is also the big surprise you have in store for Twilight, right?” asked Rarity, squinting her eyes.

“Of course!” exclaimed Dash, full of excitement. “Knowing her, she's probably already read the book ten times. But I'm sure she'll be very impressed when she sees this.”

Rainbow Dash had already imagined that moment over and over again. Her friends would flood her with questions and praise for her brilliant idea, and she would respond enthusiastically to each one. If she could avoid mentioning 'the other dangerous thing', everything she had gone through to get those documents would have been worth it.

I just need her approval... nothing more.

Guarding his emotions carefully, Dash waited with a smile. But...

None of that happened.

Instead, her friends looked at each other silently, sharing worried expressions.

“What's wrong?” asked Dash, feeling a shiver of unease as she noticed the lack of enthusiasm. “Don't they think he'll be surprised?”

She didn't reflect it on her face, but inside, a growing fear twisted her stomach.

“Of course he'll be surprised,” Applejack replied, her tone calm but firm. “It's just that your story doesn't explain what happened a moment ago.”

A slight twitch of Dash's eyelid betrayed her nervousness, though she didn't notice it herself.

“Explain what?” she replied immediately, feigning naivety.

“Who was that suspicious pony we saw earlier?” asked Applejack seriously, glaring at her.

“Oh, that? No big deal,” Dash replied, shrugging with a forced laugh. “It was just a fan I met over there. Wants me to sign a contract to be her star model. Funny, isn't it?”

His deliberately simple words hardly convinced anyone. Applejack frowned, while Rarity raised an eyebrow in obvious skepticism.

“An admirer...?” insisted Applejack, growing more and more inquisitive.

“Well, you should talk to her. She shouldn't be stalking you like that. She'll only get you in trouble and you'll end up more stressed out than you already are,” Pinkie said, pulling a muffin out of nowhere that she nibbled on nonchalantly. The other ponies gave her a brief reproachful look; they all knew Pinkie was not the best person to give such advice, considering her history of similar behavior.

“Stressed? What are you talking about, Pinkie? I'm perfectly fine,” Dash replied with a mixture of exasperation and firmness.

“Pinkie's right, dear. You look terrible. Have you seen yourself in a mirror?” commented Rarity, in her usual tone of exaggerated image concern.

Rainbow frowned, feeling a twinge of irritation. She didn't usually trust Rarity's opinions about her appearance, as she considered them too melodramatic. But the doubt had already been sown, so she decided to turn to the friend she knew would never lie to her.

“Fluttershy, do I really look that bad?” she asked, looking away from Applejack.

“Well... you're not that bad, but when you came in I really worried. Well, we all worry,” Fluttershy admitted in her soft tone, as she took out a small mirror and offered it to Dash.

With some reluctance, Rainbow looked at her reflection. Fluttershy was right. Her mane was more tousled than usual, her eyes looked slightly reddened and faint dark circles peeked under them. Although she still looked spectacular -according to herself-, she wasn't in her best shape.

“Well, I think you should talk to your 'fan' and set the record straight,” Applejack interjected, firmly. “We have a special day with Twilight today, and it wouldn't be fair to ruin it with this kind of trouble.”

Dash rolled her eyes in annoyance, letting out a sigh. “Pff, you worry too much, Applejack, everything's fine!”

At that moment, the tinkling of the carriage bell interrupted the conversation. Soon after, a train employee poked his head out, as the growing hubbub of young voices could be heard on the other side of the door.

“Excuse me, is Miss Rainbow Dash here? Several colts here would like to meet her,” the clerk announced politely. The noise on the other side increased, accompanied by excited shouts and praise directed at the pegasus.

Rainbow Dash's friends, who had turned their attention to the call, turned again to look for her? but the place where their friend should be was empty.

“Rainbow?” asked Applejack, blinking as she scanned the wagon.

A few steps ahead, Dash's outline was visible. Her head was sticking out of the window, and the rest of her body was assuming a posture suspiciously ready to jump off the moving train.

“Ha ha! It's really hot today, isn't it?” commented Dash with a nervous smile, slowly making her way back to the center of the carriage as she avoided the inquisitive stares of her friends.

[---]

The train car burst into a deafening din of cheers and shouts of excitement.

“IT'S RAINBOW DASH!”, ‘SHE'S AMAZING!’, ‘YES!’ chanted the foals, overflowing with joy, as they crowded around their idol. Their friends watched them with amused smiles, except for Applejack, who maintained a skeptical expression.

“It's okay, I got this,” Dash said, visibly perking up. She left the ponies behind and strode forward confidently. “Wow! I guess everyone came for an autograph, right?”

“YESIIIIIIIIII!” whinnied the youngsters, some jumping and others pounding the ground with their hooves in a frenzy of excitement.

The roar of screams and the reflection of her own figure in the glowing eyes of her fans stoked Rainbow Dash's spirits. Flapping her wings, she rose into the air and struck her signature pose. Any trace of fatigue or weakness disappeared from her bearing, as if the ovation itself had magically cured her exhaustion.

“Okay, okay, settle down. Line up and give me something to sign.” Dash landed next to a seat and, as if he had rehearsed the moment, pulled a pen from his mane. “Okay, who's first?”

Without hesitation, the colts and fillies lined up in an orderly row. First in line was a filly in a pink hat and ribbon, who carried a book that appeared to be a cookbook. With a beaming smile, she handed it to Dash.

“Ha? Are you sure you want me to sign here? Fine by me.” Dash quickly signed in the open book.

“YESIII! Sure! Your Blackberry Pie recipe is just like my grandmother's!” the filly said excitedly before hopping out of line.

“Huh?” muttered Dash, confused. Behind her, Pinkie Pie could be heard choking on a muffin, though Dash decided to ignore it. “Okay... Next!”

“Me! Me! Here, here,” said a colt in blue fur and white slippers, handing Dash a brochure of travel slippers.

“That's better! Here you go.” Dash quickly signed the brochure.

“Great! Now my parents will have to buy me the same sneakers you wear, yessssss!” shouted the colt before running off excitedly.

Behind Dash, her friends were exchanging murmurs. Dash didn't turn around, but her smile began to fade as an uneasy feeling came over her. Something didn't fit.

All of her friends knew perfectly well that Rainbow Dash didn't wear sneakers.

“Okay, you!” she said pointing a hoof at the next filly, a young woman with stickers on her face. “Where do you want me to sign?”

“In my fashion magazine,” the filly replied cheerfully.

“And that's because...?” asked Dash, feeling a knot in her stomach.

“Because I love your makeup! Your glitter and stickers are divine! Yiiip!” whinnied the filly excitedly.

Rainbow Dash grabbed the magazine almost ripping it out of her. As she flipped through it, a distressed expression crossed her face.

“Okay, here's your signature,” she said abruptly as she handed the magazine back and dismissed the filly. Then he turned to the remaining row.

“THANK YOU FOR COMING, BUT THAT'S IT!” he suddenly exclaimed.

A murmur of confusion ran through the foals, but before they could protest, Dash raised a hoof and added:

“I'LL CONTINUE WITH THE AUTOGRAPHS WHEN WE GET TO THE NEXT STATION! I PROMISE! RAINBOW DASH WORD!”

Perhaps because they trusted her blindly or simply out of politeness, most obeyed, although some did not hide their displeasure. With the help of the train attendant, Rainbow Dash managed to guide the young ponies out of the carriage quickly.

Dash sighed wearily as she closed the carriage door behind the last of the ponies. She had solved one problem, but now she felt an even bigger one stalking her.

“Wow, Rainbow, I didn't know you liked to wear sneakers,” Pinkie Pie commented as she examined a flyer one of the foals had dropped.

Before a second had passed, Dash reacted with impressive speed. She grabbed the brochure from Pinkie and quickly picked up all the others that were scattered on the floor, tossing them out of one of the train's windows.

“Whew, wow. Those kids should take better care where they leave their trash - cleanliness is so important! Don't you think?” said Dash, agitated, as she closed the window with a forced smile.

Her friends looked at her puzzled for a moment. Although they exchanged murmurs trying to put the matter aside, Applejack wasn't about to ignore it.

“That's enough! Rainbow Dash, what are you hiding?” the farm pony demanded in a firm tone, approaching the pegasus.

“Hiding something? What could I be hiding?” replied Dash, letting out a tense, nervous laugh.

“Ever since you arrived, I've sensed that something ISN'T RIGHT. And when something ISN'T RIGHT, I can't keep quiet. I ask you again, WHAT ARE YOU HIDING, RAINBOW DASH?”

“Hey, calm down, Applejack. It's all good. I'm not hiding anything, am I, girls?” Dash looked at her other friends, seeking their support, but silence was their only response.

Feeling the weight of her friends' disapproving looks, Dash decided she'd had enough. With an annoyed and cutting tone, she spoke:

“Y’know what? I just remembered I need to buy something. I'll go ahead. I'll see you in Canterlot.”

“You...!” Applejack tried to retort, clearly annoyed, but was interrupted by an unexpected voice.

“Thinking of leaving already, Rainbow Dash? I thought you might want to spend more time with your friends,” said an unfamiliar voice from the other end of the wagon.

They all turned their eyes to the back. There, comfortably seated with a canned soda in her hoof, was Magazine Doublereport herself.
