The Wonderbolts flew in a tight V-formation, skimming close to the ground. This arrangement left little room for maneuvering, making them vulnerable to a ground attack, but it was ideal for remaining undetected over long distances. The captain leading the group gave a signal, and the team of pegasi broke formation, swiftly ascending into the sky in different directions, blending seamlessly with the clouds.

Twilight, along with the Royal Guard soldiers, watched from a hill as the Wonderbolts continued surveying the perimeter from above. Moments earlier, she had ordered them to take her to the site of the kidnapping as quickly as possible, but they had refused, arguing that it was essential to conduct a thorough inspection first. They needed to ensure there were no additional threats and identify the best escape route in case the situation spiraled out of control.

Twilight had no intention of fleeing and leaving her friends or anypony else behind, but she knew that security protocols and preventive measures were critical in situations like this. Resigned, she accepted their decision.

“Danger, danger! How terrible, how terrible!” bleated the flocks of sheep in panic from the plain. Their cries reached Twilight, who watched them with pity as they fled in the opposite direction of her arrival.

She couldn’t blame them for making so much noise; she herself felt a twinge of fear. Before the hill where she stood loomed the source of her anxiety and the cause of the sheep’s panic.

A massive, dark, anvil-shaped cloud towered over the plain, cutting off the train’s path. It wasn’t unusual for stray rain clouds to drift from the Everfree Forest and end up in that area. However, this cloud’s absurdly perfect and well-defined shape left no doubt about its unnatural origin. It was a cloud created by magic, part of the plan of the criminal who had seized control of the train traveling from Ponyville to Canterlot.

Twilight narrowed her eyes in thought. What was the plan? Despite the many ideas swirling in her mind, she pushed them aside. It was pointless to speculate; she would get to the bottom of this soon enough.

From her vantage point, she saw the Wonderbolts returning, accompanied by a member of the Royal Guard. Led by Spitfire, the group of pegasi landed with precision in front of Twilight.

“Princess, we’ve scouted the perimeter and found nothing suspicious that might indicate the presence of accomplices. However, we’ve been unable to penetrate the cloud hovering over the train. It’s too dense and surrounded by magical winds that repel us,” Spitfire reported, her tone more serious than usual.

“I understand. Thank you, Captain. What’s the situation on the train?” Twilight asked calmly, turning to the guard who had accompanied them.

“There haven’t been any changes, Princess. The hostages are safe, and the captor hasn’t altered his demands. However, he insists on seeing you immediately or he’ll carry out his threats,” the guard responded, his frustration evident. Twilight noticed that both the Wonderbolts and the rest of the Royal Guard shared his sentiment. She felt the same way, but she knew she couldn’t let those feelings cloud her judgment. She needed to keep her mind as clear as possible to make the right decisions.

“Understood, Sergeant. Return and tell him I’ll be there shortly,” Twilight ordered. The guard left quickly.

Twilight then turned to the Wonderbolts and instructed them to continue patrolling the area. Once she finished giving her orders, Twilight, with a determined look, took to the air and headed straight for the dark cloud.

[---]

Under the shadow of the ominous cloud, everything was shrouded in deep darkness. During her flight, Twilight lit her horn, casting a soft glow that illuminated her path. Following the railroad tracks, she arrived at the halted train. Just as she had been informed, the train was in good condition, and the passengers remained calm. Considering the circumstances, the composure of the hostages was admirable—especially given that they were not alone in this place.

“Grrrr.” A series of growls and squawks broke the silence as Twilight reached the car where the captor was located.

A crowd of cockatrices surrounded both sides of the car, with some even perched on its roof.

Twilight took a deep breath before descending slowly to the ground, where the royal guard she had sent earlier was waiting for her. The cockatrices, as if obeying an invisible signal, began retreating and moving away from the area. These creatures were also part of the captor’s plan, and their presence only added to Twilight’s concerns as she considered the demands that had been made.

First, they required the immediate presence of Princess Twilight at the site. Second, she was allowed to approach the train accompanied by only one personal guard at most. Third, they would not tolerate any attempt to use force to free the hostages; otherwise, they would start reducing the number of passengers. Finally, they insisted that they only wished to talk and would not harm anyone if their conditions were met.

Twilight landed gracefully and observed the train car in front of her. It was the same one where, on so many past occasions, she had shared special moments with her friends. Now, that very car served as a prison for them, under the control of a mysterious captor.

A whirlwind of emotions surged through her, but one stood out above the rest: she was deeply upset.

“Princess Twilight Sparkle has arrived. We await your response,” the royal guard announced in a firm voice.

After a few tense seconds of silence, one of the side doors of the car opened, and a group of familiar ponies stepped out.

“TWILIGHT!” all her friends exclaimed in unison.

Pinkie Pie was the first to rush toward her, wrapping her in a warm hug. Soon, the others joined in, forming a tight, affectionate circle around her. Twilight, feeling the warmth and love of her friends, momentarily set aside her worries. For a brief moment, the fear and tension dissipated. She even felt like laughing.

“I’m so glad to see you all safe!” Twilight said with a wide smile. “Wow, the train really ran late this time.”

“It would’ve left earlier if a certain pony had gotten to the station on time,” Applejack remarked with a raised eyebrow.

“HEY, WE ALREADY CLEARED THAT UP, APPLEJACK!” Rainbow Dash protested, frowning.

“Well… I was late too,” Fluttershy admitted softly, a blush creeping onto her cheeks.

“In my defense, I arrived quite punctually along with Pinkie Pie, but I believe the engineer is largely to blame. Such lack of professionalism, showing up so late and in such a state!” Rarity said indignantly.

“Hmm, it might be that we went a tiny bit overboard with the apple cider drinking contest at the town hall party last night,” Pinkie Pie confessed with a nervous smile.

Twilight shook her head in amusement and added gently, “It doesn’t matter anymore. What’s important is that we’re togeth—”

Suddenly, a chill ran down her spine. Her friends felt it too, turning their gazes toward the source of the hostile presence.

A young pony with pink hair and dark armor was watching them from the train car they had just exited. His cold, disdainful expression was intimidating enough to freeze the air around them.

If looks could kill… Twilight thought as her eyes locked onto the intruder’s.

"GREETINGS, PRINCESS TWILIGHT SPARKLE! IT IS A PLEASURE TO FINALLY MEET YOU," the young pony announced, his voice resonating with unyielding authority.

"I'm sorry, but I don't share that sentiment given the current circumstances," Twilight replied, stepping forward to position herself between the intruder and her friends. "First of all, I would like to know who I'm speaking with."

"Is that so...? Very well," the pony responded, beginning to advance toward her with calculated steps. "My name is of no importance. However, I can clarify my position and deliver the message I was sent with."

As he approached, Twilight began to examine him closely. His jet-black armor looked as if it had been forged for an alicorn, though it was clearly imbued with enchantments. A bright and striking pink gem adorned the center of his collar, but what truly caught her attention was the emblem engraved on his chest: a tree with six stars.

("Could it be...") she thought, narrowing her eyes.

"I AM THE SEVENTH MEMBER OF THE KNIGHTS OF ORDER, BEARER OF THE ELEMENT OF JUSTICE, AND I HAVE COME TO FINISH BY FORCE THE MISSION ASSIGNED TO MY COMRADES!" the pony proclaimed, raising his voice to echo even within the train cars.

Twilight sensed uneasy murmurs behind her; her friends exchanged surprised looks. Yet she remained motionless, her gaze fixed firmly on the intruder.

The pony stopped a few steps away from her. "However, I do not wish to fight," he said in a softer tone. "Surrender your Elements of Harmony... and there will be peace between us."

The air grew heavy, and a cold breeze swept across the plains, attempting to fill the silence that now blanketed the scene. Twilight closed her eyes, taking a deep breath as she considered her response. She didn’t need much time; the answer was clear, though she fervently wished there were another option.

"I'm sorry," she finally said, opening her eyes with resolve. "My answer is the same I gave your comrades. The physical forms of the Elements were destroyed long ago. Now, their magic lives solely within us."

The pony tilted his head slightly, as if reflecting on her words. "I see," he replied calmly. Then, spreading his wings, his voice turned strong and cutting once more. "In that case, there is only one path we can take..."

A chorus of growls and squawks erupted around them. Twilight quickly glanced in all directions, noticing how the cockatrices began to surround them once again. Her friends adopted defensive stances, as did the royal guard accompanying them. Through the train windows, Twilight could see the frightened faces of innocent ponies—elderly ones, mothers clutching their foals—all watching in fear.

"WAIT! THIS ISN’T THE RIGHT PLACE FOR THIS," Twilight exclaimed, raising her voice.

"WE WILL SETTLE THIS HERE AND NOW!" the pony replied coldly.

"DO YOU INTEND TO INVOLVE THE CIVILIANS ON THE TRAIN AS WELL?" Twilight demanded, her voice tinged with indignation.

The pony was silent for a moment. The sounds of the cockatrices suddenly ceased. Finally, he spoke in a calmer tone: "The innocent should not bear the weight of your failures... I will allow the train passengers to leave. You have fifteen minutes. But you will remain here."

Without another word, he turned and walked toward a nearby rock by the tracks. With slow, deliberate movements, he sat down on it, his gaze still fixed on Twilight.

Twilight took a deep breath, trying to keep her composure. She had secured a concession from her opponent, but she was certain it would be the only one. With a gesture, she called over the royal guard who stood nearby.

"Find the Wonderbolts and tell them to come immediately," she ordered firmly.

The guard quickly departed, returning soon with the team of acrobatic pegasi. The instructions they received were clear and direct: evacuate all the train passengers as quickly as possible.

The Wonderbolts wasted no time. In the blink of an eye, they opened the train doors and organized the passengers into a neat line. The ponies began to disembark and move away from the area, some nervously waving at Twilight and her friends, while others looked at them with evident concern.

Amid the crowd, a group of foals momentarily broke away from the line and ran toward Rainbow Dash, holding a small flower crown.

"KICK THAT VILLAIN'S BUTT!" they shouted enthusiastically before running back to their parents.

Rainbow Dash puffed out her chest, thrilled. "DON'T WORRY, I'LL GIVE THAT JERK WHAT HE DESERVES—I PROMISE, OR I'LL STOP CALLING MYSELF RAINBOW DASH!"

However, after her declaration, she quickly turned to observe the mysterious pony. But he didn't react. He remained still, eyes closed, as if meditating in absolute calm.

Twilight was also watching him, analyzing every detail. It was evident that he hadn't responded at all.

Applejack approached Twilight's side, followed by the others.

"What do you think he's planning?" Applejack asked in a low voice.

"I don't know. The more I watch, the stranger this whole thing seems... Did he speak to you or do anything while I was gone?"

Pinkie Pie shook her head. "Not a thing."

"Quite lacking in manners for someone who calls himself a knight," added Rarity with a sigh of disdain.

"He just stood there like a fool after threatening us. If you'd let me, I would’ve..." Rainbow Dash began, stomping the ground with one hoof.

"I think he's scared," Fluttershy suddenly said, her voice barely audible.

"What?" they all responded in unison, turning to look at her.

Fluttershy hesitated but then gathered her courage and continued: "I mean... I think he's scared. Baby hedgehogs adopt a similar posture when their parents have been away for too long." She pointed to the mysterious pony, who remained seated with his front legs apart and his head tilted toward the ground.

"Fluttershy, darling, we appreciate your perspective, but he isn't a hedgehog—he's a pony," Rarity replied with an indulgent smile.

"Yeah, a pony from Cunabula," added Pinkie Pie in a tone that sounded more like a whimsical thought than a fact.

A spark went off in Twilight's mind. Cunabula? Could ponies from there really exist? She had no evidence to support it, but she also couldn’t rule it out. If it were true, why resort to such flashy tactics instead of infiltrating more subtly? And then there was the gem on his armor...

A loud chorus of squawking broke her train of thought. The cockatrices, which had followed the passengers’ retreat, announced that everyone was now far enough away.

The pony raised his head mechanically, as if awakening from a trance. His eyes shone with wild determination. This was the moment he had been waiting for over the past twelve hours.

The fate of Equestria depended on what was about to happen. No, not just Equestria—of the entire world.

A dense fog began to descend from the massive cloud hovering above them. Thunder and lightning tore through the sky, accompanied by a fierce wind that lashed the plains with growing intensity.

The ponies, alerted by these ominous signs, instinctively gathered around Twilight, ready to face any threat that might arise. However, a brilliant light caught their attention, distracting them entirely.

Where the young armored pony stood, a golden halo began to form around him, enveloping him completely. Slowly, his figure rose into the air, as if he were the very epicenter of the storm raging around them.

"GREAT WALL OF LAMENTATION!" he exclaimed in a thunderous voice that echoed like a storm.

From his body, a rainbow-colored light shot into the sky, piercing the clouds like a radiant spear. Within seconds, the light climbed to a prodigious height until it seemed to strike an invisible, solid ceiling above. Then, it began to expand, taking the shape of a gigantic dome that plummeted toward the ground with alarming speed.

"IT'S A BARRIER!" Twilight shouted, panic gripping her as she realized her enemy’s intentions and the little time they had to escape the relentless trap he had unleashed. Convinced of the dangerous scenario they would face if the dome caught them, she immediately cast a teleportation spell. To her dismay, it failed completely.

Her magic dissipated into the air as if something had neutralized it.

She turned to the pony hovering defiantly amidst the storm, focusing her attention on the pink gem gleaming on his chest. Then, a fleeting memory crossed her mind, and everything clicked. The gem was the genuine Starheart, an artifact whose mysterious power should never be underestimated under any circumstances.

"Quickly! Fluttershy, Dash, grab the others. We need to get out of here! Now!" Twilight commanded firmly as she took to the air, carrying Rarity with her.

Without hesitation, Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy each picked up Applejack and Pinkie Pie, lifting them off the ground and flying toward the horizon, seeking an escape through the nearest point where the barrier had yet to close completely.

Badwhiz, watching their movements, smirked with satisfaction.

"HOW PITIFUL, PRINCESS!" he roared mockingly. "YOUR COWARDICE IS AS GREAT AS YOUR IGNORANCE!"

A massive shadow descended from the sky, blocking the fleeing ponies’ path. An enormous dragon-like beast appeared out of nowhere, obstructing their escape route. From the creature's jaws emanated a sulfuric light, aimed directly at them.

Twilight, who had moved as far as she could from Badwhiz, cast the teleportation spell she had been preparing. A second later, they disappeared in a flash of magic, just before being engulfed by a torrent of toxic smoke and fire.

Badwhiz, observing this final act, smiled even wider. The first phase had been completed successfully. Everything was going according to plan.
