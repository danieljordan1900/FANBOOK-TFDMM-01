The wind blew gently over the calm lake in the middle of the Great Barrier. On one of its shores, a small pink butterfly fluttered its wings, exhausted, in a desperate attempt to reach a safe place. Not far from its trajectory, the last cargo car of the Ponyville-to-Canterlot train lay overturned on the ground. Unlike the other train cars that had sunk into the lake, this one remained in perfect condition despite having been attacked by the same elemental forces that had destroyed the train.

With renewed hope, the little butterfly pushed itself to the limit to reach the car, and after several failed attempts, it finally succeeded. Exhausted, it rested on one of its wheels.

Even though only a gentle breeze was blowing at that moment, for that tiny butterfly, the journey had felt like crossing a hurricane.

After several minutes of rest on the train car, the small butterfly turned its attention to the horizon.

On the other side of the lake, a massive dust cloud rose, and thunderous sounds resembling explosions began to echo, filling the entire Great Barrier with a deafening resonance.

The new threat filled the little butterfly with distress, and without wasting a second, it sought refuge within the metallic openings revealed in the overturned car. Its search was brief, as it quickly found a hole in the nearby air ducts and entered without hesitation.

That tiny creature vanished from the sight of anyone who might have been watching. However, in this world of conflict, few had eyes for such seemingly insignificant details.

[---]

"TRHROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"

A rain of massive boulders struck the forest bordering the Great Barrier. Trees and old structures shattered under the impact of rocks as large as carts. The relentless downpour of stones continued for several seconds until, at last, the bombardment ceased.

The gray dust cloud left in the wake of the rockfall began to settle slowly, revealing a wasteland of destruction.

Badwhiz, who had never before witnessed such an impressive display of power from Ceridwen, was utterly astonished. So much so that, for a moment, he thought the battle was already over.

However, to Ceridwen, a battle-hardened magic veteran who had faced the princess and her entourage in the past, that attack alone should not have been enough to defeat her opponent.

"I don’t think you’re so weak as to believe that a few mere rocks are enough to take you down," Ceridwen mused as she assumed a defensive stance and ignited the two golden rods floating around her with magic. Behind her, Badwhiz finally realized the fight wasn’t over yet and quickly followed her lead to cover her back. Between them, a crystal cube floated.

Around them, the dust swirled in gray gusts, barely masking the tense atmosphere.

Minutes earlier, Ceridwen had arrived at the battlefield. After ordering Badwhiz to deliver an ultimatum to the princess—informing her that her companions had already been captured and that she must surrender—she proceeded to attack with a rain of boulders upon receiving an unfavorable response. Of course, she had no interest in hearing the princess pony’s excuses; if she didn’t surrender immediately, there was no point in wasting even a single word.

Even in the midst of such a sudden attack, the princess did not fall into panic or confusion. She skillfully dodged the magically propelled boulders and retreated with her companion until she disappeared from Ceridwen’s sight.

The look in the princess’s eyes before she left was one Ceridwen knew all too well—it was the look of someone determined to fight.

A counterattack was imminent.

The dust had fully cleared when, not far from them, Twilight emerged from behind the rocks and fired a precise beam of magic from her horn straight at Ceridwen.

The counterattack had begun sooner than Ceridwen had anticipated, but only that was unexpected.

Twilight’s bold, direct attack crashed against the solid magical barrier that Badwhiz had erected. The attack proved ineffective. Seeing an opportunity, Ceridwen acted in perfect sync with Badwhiz, who lowered the barrier, allowing her to immediately launch one of her golden rods at Twilight.

The rod did not travel toward its target like an arrow, but instead rolled sideways like a wheel. Midway through its trajectory, it grew exponentially, hitting the ground under its own weight and continuing forward like a massive steamroller.

Twilight was greatly surprised to witness the manifestation of this magic. The rolling advance of the enormous rod and the rocks scattering in all directions left her no choice but to take to the sky to avoid being crushed by the colossal roller.

Now airborne, Twilight had become an easy target.

("Switch!") Ceridwen mentally commanded Badwhiz. In a perfectly synchronized move that lasted less than a second, the two partners swapped positions. Now, Badwhiz was in front of Twilight, free to attack her directly with his black lightning.

One after another, bolts of black lightning shot toward Twilight in the sky. Some grazed her trail, others passed dangerously close, but most missed their mark. Twilight was not the best flyer, but her strong wings and knowledge of flight gave her just enough advantage to evade Badwhiz’s relentless barrage.

Ceridwen, behind him, paid no attention. She knew Badwhiz would not be able to bring down the princess. His only purpose at that moment was to keep her occupied. The real attack would come from behind.

Rainbow Dash, fast as a lightning bolt, burst out from the remains of the shattered forest and headed straight for Ceridwen at a speed impossible to stop. The agile pegasus effortlessly dodged the barrage of pellets Ceridwen fired to slow her down. With no more obstacles in her way, Rainbow Dash accelerated to her maximum speed and slid along the ground until she was directly beneath Ceridwen. In what could have been barely two seconds, both adversaries found themselves less than a meter apart. Then, showcasing her extraordinary agility, Rainbow Dash kicked out with her hind legs straight at Ceridwen’s face, aiming to knock her unconscious in a single blow.

Ceridwen expected nothing less. It wasn’t the first time she had faced this swift pegasus.

Their first encounter had taken place during the conspiracy in Ornitia, where Ceridwen’s initial efforts to prevent the activation of the Tree of Harmony in that kingdom were thwarted by Rainbow Dash and her companions. At that moment, she had been surprised to witness Rainbow Dash’s speed firsthand. Shortly after retreating from there, she had been even more astounded to learn that the same pegasus had traveled from that kingdom’s capital to the capital of Equestria in less than a day.

Their second encounter took place in Canterlot, and unfortunately, it had ended in disaster. While trying to carry out Danu’s negligent orders, Ceridwen had been ambushed by the Princess and her allies. That confrontation had been brief and humiliating. After being bombarded by a relentless wave of attacks that left her no chance to defend herself, she was ultimately defeated under the hooves of the pony friends.

Yes, Ceridwen could accept her defeat. However, what she could not accept was that those encounters had been so one-sided.

Now, in their third clash, with equal numbers, Ceridwen was certain this battle would not end like the previous ones.

Ceridwen vanished just before Rainbow Dash’s imminent attack could connect. The pegasus shot past her target, missing entirely. While to an outsider it might have seemed that Ceridwen had teleported, Rainbow Dash knew otherwise. Ceridwen, using her magic to manipulate size, had shrunk down to a nearly invisible speck. Yet even in such a tiny form, she still had full control of her powers.

The second rod, still floating in the air, transformed into a tiny yet razor-sharp dart. At one of its ends, the now-microscopic Ceridwen positioned herself and aimed at Rainbow Dash from behind. With the pegasus in her sights, she unleashed her true attack with the projectile.

Rainbow Dash, who had turned around to keep track of the minuscule Ceridwen, noticed a small golden glint where her opponent had been.

No, it wasn’t just a glint. Rainbow Dash’s instincts flared, and she instinctively stretched her neck back as far as she could, narrowly dodging the sharp object that was headed straight for her head. The projectile whizzed past and embedded itself into a rock far behind Rainbow Dash.

Disoriented by the immense effort she had made to avoid the unexpected attack, Rainbow Dash lost her flight rhythm and tumbled across the ground, rolling until she crashed against the same rock behind her. Despite all that, thanks to her quick reflexes, she managed to slow herself down just enough to emerge unscathed from the impact.

The rock behind Rainbow Dash wasn’t so lucky.

As she casually glanced at where the dart had struck, Rainbow Dash’s eyes widened in shock, a feeling of distress washing over her as she saw a deep hole in the rock. That was where the projectile had embedded itself completely, revealing the sheer lethality of the attack.

"SERIOUSLY! DO YOU WANT TO CAPTURE US OR GET RID OF US? MAKE UP YOUR MINDS!" Rainbow Dash exploded, visibly irritated.

"Khiss," Ceridwen clicked her tongue as she returned to her normal size. She was annoyed as well. The attack she had executed was one of the ones she had practiced most since her imprisonment in Tartarus, perfecting it specifically for Rainbow Dash. However, after its recent unsuccessful execution, she would have to consider it a wasted effort.

"Lady Ceridwen, above!" Badwhiz suddenly called out in a mental message.

Huge rocks began to rain down on their position. Both Ceridwen and Badwhiz retreated, increasing the distance between them and Rainbow Dash. Badwhiz quickly raised the barrier again, shielding them from the smaller stones that scattered around them.

Through the dust that had been stirred up, Ceridwen saw Twilight rushing over to Rainbow Dash, then disappearing with her companion in a teleportation spell.

"You can't fight on your own without an advantage, can you, little princess?" Ceridwen mocked inwardly, satisfied. Now she was convinced that her opponent was no better than her or her allies. There was no special force protecting that pony from behind, and soon, there would be no one left standing in front of her either.

[---]

"That wasn’t right," said Rainbow Dash, clearly annoyed.

"No, it wasn’t," Twilight admitted as she lay on the ground. She was somewhat exhausted after repeatedly dodging Badwhiz's lightning. She had no serious injuries, though the tips of her tail and some parts of her coat showed signs of scorching.

Both ponies found themselves once again at the bottom of the dead-end pit. The gloomy place, illuminated only by Twilight’s magical light, was a physical representation of the complicated situation they were in.

"And now there are two... What are they? Twins?" Rainbow Dash asked, thinking about their two nearly identical opponents.

"I don’t think so. One of them is an enchanted spirit—that's Badwhiz outside his body. The other... should be the real Vanilla."

"'Should'?" Rainbow Dash asked, puzzled.

"He hasn’t physically revealed himself yet. He’s just using Badwhiz’s body as a hostage."

"He didn’t seem like a hostage, Twilight. He looked pretty cooperative to me."

"We can’t rule anything out yet, Rainbow Dash. We don’t know enough."

"Right, we don’t know..." Rainbow Dash replied, irritated, as she stared pensively at one of the walls.

A new pause settled between the two friends. Rainbow Dash’s frustration was palpable, and it pained Twilight that she couldn’t provide her friend with more answers.

"Didn’t you say those guys would try to capture us instead of attacking us directly?" Rainbow Dash asked, turning her gaze to Twilight.

"It seems their plans are different. What Badwhiz said earlier was just a ruse to make us lower our guard."

"That little..." Rainbow Dash's feathers bristled.

"In fact, it’s likely that everything he’s told us from the beginning has been a lie."

"Wait... then, are the girls okay?" Rainbow Dash exclaimed, hope creeping into her voice.

"No, but that crystal he claimed they’re trapped in must be a trap."

"Then they..." Rainbow Dash started to say hesitantly.

"Hey! No, no, Rainbow, that can't be. They must have been captured," Twilight quickly responded upon seeing the worry on Rainbow Dash’s face.

"How do you know?" Dash replied, now distressed.

"I would have felt it. You would have felt it too. That couldn’t have happened," Twilight assured, shaking her head. Even though there was a strong possibility that their friends had been eliminated, those thoughts remained only in her mind. Deep within her being, Twilight felt that her friends were still there, though distant. It was the same feeling she had when she faced the Villains’ Alliance that attacked Canterlot before her coronation. Despite the overwhelming desperation she had felt at that time, she never sensed loss—only abandonment and failure.

"I have faith that they are still here. But they are prisoners of the enemy. We must do everything we can to free them," Twilight continued with renewed determination.

Despite the strong will Twilight expressed, doubt was already beginning to weigh on Rainbow Dash...

"But what do we do, Twilight? If we keep going like this, we’ll lose," Rainbow Dash said with concern.

For Twilight, this was a question with no easy answer.

After Badwhiz’s companion had arrived—without even exchanging a single word between them—Badwhiz had announced that the rest of their friends had been captured inside a crystal cube and that they should surrender. Twilight had attempted to start a conversation at that moment but was interrupted by a violent barrage of rocks launched by the newly arrived Vanilla. With negotiations no longer an option, Twilight had to quickly coordinate with Rainbow Dash to execute a fast attack and free their friends.

The attack plan was for Twilight to simulate an offensive to distract Badwhiz’s companion while Rainbow Dash would stealthily move from behind, ambush Badwhiz from the shadows, defeat him, and take the crystal. This maneuver had to be executed swiftly and decisively to succeed. Unfortunately, their opponents’ coordination turned out to be better than expected. Not only that, but they also responded immediately to their actions with a counterattack that had nearly taken one of them down.

Continuing with this same strategy until the enemy made a mistake would be a path to failure, given how well-prepared their adversaries were. Trying to deceive them with a trick carried risks and the possibility that one of them might have to make a sacrifice. Negotiation was pointless...

One by one, ideas crossed Twilight’s mind, but none were acceptable; all had too many drawbacks. The only way to rescue their friends without losing the one still with her would be if they could somehow become magically faster and stronger—but that last part was impossible at the moment.

Twilight had already used up all the enchanted crystals she could, and she had no additional magical artifacts to give them the advantage they so desperately needed.

Rainbow Dash watched with concern as Twilight sank into deep concentration with her eyes closed... until finally, she exhaled.

"We have no choice but to try to deceive them, pretend that one of us was injured or weakened in battle, and hope that Badwhiz or his other companion lets their guard down when they try to capture us..." Twilight responded resignedly. She had opened her eyes again, but they held a tired look.

"Seriously? Do you really think they'd be naive enough to fall for something like that?" Rainbow Dash replied skeptically.

"If I break my horn in front of them, that should definitely cause some reaction."

Rainbow Dash's eyes widened. But before she could say anything, Twilight continued. "I won’t actually break my horn; it’ll just be a very convincing trick to fool them. I learned it from a performance by Trixie and Starlight last year. Honestly, their acting was incredibly realistic," Twilight concluded with a slightly forced smile.

"Well, then it might actually work," Rainbow Dash replied, rubbing her chin. It was clear she wasn’t entirely convinced.

"The other option is for you to pretend you lost your wings in an attack, but first, I’d have to remove them with magic..."

"Whoa! On second thought, I think it’s much more believable if you lose your horn," Rainbow Dash immediately said, somewhat nervous, as she flexed her wings. "I really couldn’t handle losing my wings again."

Hearing that last part, Twilight froze.

Rainbow Dash’s words had awakened an old memory within her and, along with it, reignited the fire of hope that had been fading. She could almost feel her heart leap with excitement. She had found the answer she desperately needed!

"THAT’S IT, RAINBOW DASH! YOU’RE BRILLIANT!" Twilight exclaimed, using her magic to pull Rainbow Dash in for an affectionate hug.

"Hey! No! No, Twilight! Your idea of breaking your horn is better than taking my wings. Seriously! I just told you!" Rainbow Dash responded, visibly nervous.

"That’s not what I meant. Do you remember when some evil unicorns took your wings a while back? And what happened after that?" Twilight asked, her eyes shining, waiting for her friend to understand what she was thinking.

"Hmm... Well, we went after those guys... but they captured us and then..."

"Then?"

Rainbow Dash’s eyes seemed lost in her memories until they finally lit up as she recalled that moment. Excited, she finally understood what her friend was getting at. There was only one way to respond.

"TWILIGHT-DASH! OH, YEAH!" Rainbow Dash exclaimed, doing a mid-air flip in excitement.

Twilight-Dash was the fusion between Twilight and Rainbow Dash. It had occurred years ago when they were captured by some evil unicorns who had stolen Rainbow Dash’s wings to turn themselves into alicorns. At that time, Twilight’s magic wasn’t enough to free them. That’s when the idea of fusing together came up in order to defeat those villains. The resulting fusion was so powerful that it practically humiliated those dangerous mages, who, unable to defend themselves, ended up surrendering and begging for mercy.

This was their best chance to win.

"We need to start right away. The spell I used back then was temporary and limited. This time, I’ll do it much better," Twilight proposed, stomping the ground with her hoof. Without saying anything more, she ignited her horn and began to concentrate.

"Ha! Back then, I didn’t have my wings. But now that I do, can you imagine how fast we’re going to be? IT’LL BE TWICE AS 20% COOLER!" Rainbow Dash exclaimed, flapping her wings, already fantasizing about the extraordinary aerial stunts she’d be able to pull off soon.

A tremor was felt around them. Pieces of earth started falling from above.

"An impatient audience," Rainbow Dash mocked with a smirk as she looked up at the empty ceiling.

"I’m almost done," Twilight responded, the light from her horn shining at full intensity.

A magical glow began to emanate from Twilight’s horn, signaling the start of the spell. Soft as a shimmering silk blanket, the magic enveloped both ponies, and between them, strands of light emerged and intertwined. Slowly, two cocoons of light formed, drawing closer together. Soon, both cocoons met and quickly fused into one. The light of the new, large cocoon gleamed, sprinkled with all the colors of the rainbow, before compressing and dimming like a paper lantern in the darkness of the pit.

Then, a crack appeared, and the light of a pair of eyes was revealed to the world.
