An intense flash of light burst behind a hill.

Twilight and the rest of the ponies unexpectedly reappeared in the middle of a lush green pasture sprinkled with flowers. It was a surprise, especially for Twilight, who had cast a spell to teleport them all to Canterlot. After a quick look around, she realized they were still inside the barrier that had just closed. Surrounding them was a solid, translucent white wall of magic separating them from the rest of the world. Beyond it, blurry and distant, Canterlot could be seen—the destination they were supposed to have reached.

"Umph, Twilight, why are we still here?" Dash asked, voicing the same question on everyone’s mind.

Twilight didn’t answer right away. She had no good explanation. She thought she had cast the spell before the barrier had closed, yet they were still there.

"I don’t know. We were supposed to be in Canterlot… this barrier must have blocked the teleportation..." Twilight said as she conjured a scroll and sent it with a spell.

The scroll disappeared in a swirl of magic but immediately reappeared, falling unceremoniously to the ground.

"…and it also blocks communications," Twilight added with a tone of disappointment.

"Does that mean we’re trapped?" Fluttershy asked.

"It seems so," Twilight replied calmly, though she was making a great effort to hide her distress. The rest of her friends exchanged worried glances. Twilight didn’t want to alarm them, but as she had feared, everything pointed to this being a deliberate plan to prevent their escape. The Knights of Order’s new ally had three years to prepare for this scenario and had likely taken every precaution.

The situation was dire. Twilight sighed internally under the weight of her conclusions. This wasn’t the bonding time with her friends she had hoped for. But she had to face the adversity; she wouldn’t give up—not with her friends by her side.

"Let’s stay calm. We might be trapped in this barrier, but that doesn’t mean we’re entirely powerless. We’re still free, and we’re together. That means we can do a lot to disrupt our opponent’s plans," Twilight declared with conviction, stepping forward.

Rainbow Dash and Applejack nodded determinedly, and the others quickly followed suit.

"That’s the spirit, Twilight. Let’s make sure ‘Vanilla’ doesn’t get away with this!" Pinkie Pie exclaimed.

The ponies looked at each other, puzzled. "Vanilla?"

"Of course! Didn’t you see that guy’s mane color?" Pinkie responded, flipping her own mane dramatically, clearly referring to the mysterious pony who had trapped them.

"Sorry, darling Pinkie Pie, but I think you’re mistaken. His mane color was more of a flamingo pink with hints of chestnut gold," Rarity clarified.

"What does his mane color matter?! He’s a villain, isn’t he?!" Dash exclaimed, exasperated.

"Yes, but just calling him ‘villain’ isn’t very polite," Pinkie retorted.

"I think ‘Vanilla’ suits him," Fluttershy added softly.

"Well, I don’t mind calling him ‘Vanilla’ if everyone else does. At least until he tells us his name… though honestly, I don’t want to hear it," Applejack said, sounding slightly annoyed.

"Well, I disagree. If we’re naming him based on his mane, ‘Rosewood’ would be more appropriate," Rarity protested.

"Rosewood?" Dash repeated as if the word left a bad taste in her mouth. "Please, let’s just call him ‘Vanilla.’ What do you say?"

Everyone raised their hooves in agreement, except for Rarity, who wore an evident look of displeasure. Finally, they all turned their gazes toward Twilight.

"Alright, ‘Vanilla’ will be our opponent, and we’ll call him that until he properly introduces himself like any other pony," Twilight declared.

Once again, everyone nodded.

Twilight hadn’t expected the conversation to revolve around naming the enemy, but she didn’t interrupt. She didn’t know the pony’s identity either. He possessed the Starheart gem—of that, she was certain—but she couldn’t confirm if it was related to that unicorn family.

Suddenly, a roar echoed in the distance, startling all the ponies.

In an almost instinctive movement, they grouped around Twilight to protect her while keeping their flanks covered. Several tense seconds passed as they awaited a possible attack from the enemy who had imprisoned them, but nothing happened.

Twilight sighed in relief, and the others relaxed.

"We need to start moving. Vanilla could be looking for us right now, and this isn’t the best place to stay hidden. We need to find shelter soon. Let’s go, ponies," Twilight urged.

With determined steps, she and the group of ponies began heading toward the nearest hill’s highest point.

The journey was short, and they soon reached the hill. Though not very tall, it provided the security the group needed at that moment. On one side of the hill were large slabs of rocks piled atop one another, surrounded by low but dense vegetation.

After a quick scan of the surroundings, Twilight nodded to herself. This spot seemed suitable.

"Alright, this should do. Rainbow Dash, come with me. Applejack and the rest, keep scouting the area, and be very careful not to reveal our position," Twilight instructed.

Wasting no time, all the ponies got to work.

[---]

Beyond the rocks covering the hilltop, Twilight and Rainbow Dash carefully moved through the bushes. Twilight's first objective was to get a clear view of the current state of the terrain within the barrier. The second objective was to find a safe place where they could hide from Vainilla.

Slowly, they reached a clearing and began surveying the horizon.

Just as Twilight had indicated, they were trapped inside a barrier. The entire horizon was tinted with the translucent white color of the massive magical dome enclosing them. It was a considerable area, large enough to fit Ponyville within its borders—and even Sweet Apple Acres’ fields could easily be contained.

"Wow, that’s a huge barrier," Rainbow Dash remarked, staring intently at the horizon.

"Yeah, but why is it so big?" Twilight replied.

"Uh… I think you’re asking the wrong pony. I don’t know much about this magic stuff, Twilight."

"Any opinion right now could be helpful. I don’t know either. If Vainilla wanted to catch us quickly, he’d have made the barrier much smaller."

"Uhmm, makes sense...", Rainbow Dash replied hesitantly, then turned a serious gaze skyward. After a brief silence, she said, “Hey, Twilight, why don't we blow up this barrier with the usual rainbow beam?".

It was a logical idea. However, Twilight frowned immediately. She had thought about it before and had come up with a disturbing answer.

"Rainbow Dash, think about it for a moment.... Do you really believe wholeheartedly that that will work?", Twilight asked without turning to her.

Rainbow Dash remained silent, her gaze fixed on the fake sky.

"I don't know... but I have a feeling it couldn't be that easy," she replied, squinting.

"It doesn't look like it's going to be that easy to me either, Rainbow Dash...", Twilight muttered before falling silent and continuing to stare at the horizon.

The large storm cloud that had covered the area earlier had dissipated, leaving vast stretches of flooded plains. The sky now appeared clear, though its oval shape reflected the dome of magic enclosing them. At the center of the barrier stood the train and an unusual dark figure resembling a large stable.

The dark shape shifted, and a new roar echoed within the barrier. It was clear that the figure was no stable at all.

Both ponies sharpened their vision as much as possible.

The dark figure spread its wings, fully revealing itself under the daylight. The creature resembled a dragon in its wings and hind legs but also displayed traits clearly related to an enormous bird. It had a large red crest, a sharp, jagged beak, and green feathers in dark and light shades adorning its chest and wings. Bright red feather tufts on its neck and head gave it a majestic and commanding appearance, further reinforcing the mythical aura emanating from its presence.

"A cocatriz?" both ponies exclaimed in surprise, recognizing the beast before them.

Indeed, it was a cocatriz, but unlike any they had seen before. Its size rivaled that of a full-grown dragon.

"Seriously? Are cocatrices really that big in 'Cunobula'?" Rainbow Dash asked, scratching her head.

"I don’t think so. Judging by its features, it closely resembles a Cocatriz Titanicus—a mythical creature native to Equestria that hasn’t been seen in over a thousand years… I can’t believe I’m seeing one right now," Twilight said, her voice a mix of amazement and disbelief. "By the way, it’s Cunábula, not ‘Cunobula,’ Rainbow."

"Whatever. So, do you know this thing? Do you know how to beat it?" Dash asked, slightly bewildered by Twilight’s enthusiasm.

"Yes, but it’s better if I explain it with the others. Besides… I don’t see Vainilla. Do you spot him anywhere, Rainbow?" Twilight asked, her gaze turning serious as she scanned the horizon.

"Nope. He might be hiding behind that giant cocatriz. But that’d be way too convenient," Dash replied, glaring warily toward the imposing creature.

Indeed, the Cocatriz Titanicus stood alone near the train. There was no sign of the pony who had trapped them, nor of the smaller cocatrices that had been present earlier. Apart from the beast’s occasional roars, a strange calm settled over the plain.

Suddenly, the silence was broken by a new and curious sound. It resembled a drumbeat mixed with a sharp trumpeting noise. The rhythm, initially soft, began to intensify, repeating over and over until it resonated clearly throughout the barrier.

Twilight and Rainbow exchanged confused looks and turned their attention back to the center of the barrier, where the massive creature lay in a state of rest. The sound they heard felt oddly familiar, but it was hard to believe such a noise could come from such an imposing creature.

After listening to the chant for several seconds, Twilight finally reacted.

"Uhmm, Rainbow Dash, what do you think that sound means—the one the Cocatriz Titanicus is making right now?" Twilight asked, as if pondering aloud. She anticipated Dash’s response, hoping the well-traveled pegasus might interpret the sound differently from the obvious and rather crude conclusion Twilight had in mind.

"I think it’s laying an egg, Twilight," Pinkie Pie replied simply, suddenly appearing between the two ponies.

"That’s not possible!" Twilight immediately retorted, paying no attention to Pinkie’s sudden appearance by her side.

"Pinkie Pie! What are you doing here?" Rainbow Dash asked, surprised to see their pink friend disguised as a bush.

"We were carefully exploring the area, just like Twilight ordered," Pinkie responded with an expression that was both playful and serious. Twilight, who had just noticed Pinkie’s presence, nodded in acknowledgment.

"Ah, right… wait, we were?" said Dash. At that moment, another bush next to Pinkie rustled, and Fluttershy’s head emerged, startling the rainbow-maned pegasus once again. Her friend’s face was covered in paint, giving her the appearance of a seasoned guerrilla fighter.

"Sorry. Since we were trying to stay as inconspicuous as possible, Rarity made us these costumes and prepared some makeup to help us blend in… well, there were only enough berries to do one of us," Fluttershy said, sounding slightly embarrassed.

"Don’t worry about that, Fluttershy. Where’s the rest of the group?" Rainbow Dash asked.

"They’re trying to figure out how deep the rabbit burrow we found under the rocks is," Pinkie Pie replied, pulling a handful of berries from her mane and offering them to Rainbow Dash and Twilight.

"A rabbit burrow?" Twilight interrupted, hopeful.

"Yes, Twilight. There’s a big rabbit burrow beneath the hill. It’s abandoned, but it’s in really good condition. All of us could fit in there without any problem," Fluttershy explained.

Twilight felt a flicker of joy inside her. This was good news. They had, to some extent, achieved the initial objectives they had set. Now, they needed to assess the situation with the rest of the group and start working on a plan. Even though they still didn’t know where Vainilla was…

"Is that… is that a cocatriz?" Fluttershy asked, her voice a mix of fear and amazement as she stared into the distance.

There was a moment of silence, broken only by the birdlike cawing of the imposing beast on the horizon.

"I think we’ve seen enough here. Let’s continue this conversation with the others inside the rabbit burrow," Twilight spoke in a low but firm voice. Understanding the words of their princess friend, all the ponies began retreating, aided by Pinkie Pie’s exaggerated stealth skills. However, halfway to their destination, Rainbow Dash stopped abruptly and quickly turned to look over the bushes.

"Is something wrong, Rainbow?" Twilight asked, her expression growing serious as she noticed the tension in the rainbow-maned pegasus.

"No… I don’t think so… Let’s get inside quickly," Dash replied, glancing warily at the sky above her.

[---]

In the abandoned train from Ponyville to Canterlot, a mysterious figure carefully made its way among the fallen luggage inside the train. Without rushing, they reached the administrative car near the locomotive engine. Once inside, without wasting any time, they opened the shelves of documents, took the train’s logbook, and began studying the latest entries written in it.

[---]

Shortly after, in the rabbit burrow beneath the hill, Twilight had just taken a seat and was lost in thought, mentally piecing together all the events that had unfolded throughout the afternoon. Her friends had also taken their seats and were discussing the recent discoveries they had made.

"You shouldn’t have eaten all those berries, Pinkie Pie. Now we don’t have enough to make the makeup I need to camouflage all of us," said Rarity, clearly frustrated.

"But I had to make sure which ones were poisonous and which weren’t," replied Pinkie Pie, still munching on more berry-like fruits.

"I didn’t need to know which were edible to make the makeup and—by Celestia, could you stop eating the remaining ones!" Rarity snapped impatiently.

"But these are berries," Pinkie replied nonchalantly.

"Wait... are they red or blue?" Rarity asked with sudden interest.

"Would you all just stop that already!" Applejack interjected angrily, stomping her hoof on the stone table in frustration at her friends’ trivial argument.

Twilight lifted her gaze and looked around. The room was spacious and reminded her a lot of her old home in the Ponyville library. Although much of the walls were simply rock, other sections revealed old logs and roots protruding with lush greenery. It wasn’t a dirty or messy environment but rather well-maintained and clean, giving it a familiar and cozy appearance.

The burrow was also beautifully lit by white crystals embedded in the ceiling. These lights, along with the seating and other decorative details that were uncommon for such a place, had been crafted by Rarity in an impressively short amount of time. Though Twilight knew her designer friend well, she was always amazed by how quickly Rarity could leave her mark on any place she found herself.

That brief moment of distraction passed quickly. Once again, her mind focused on the current crisis they were facing.

"Applejack, Rarity, what do you think about the depth of the rabbit tunnels we found?" Twilight asked, breaking the silence.

"Well, I can’t say for sure. Some don’t lead anywhere. Others are too narrow for a pony to pass through. Fluttershy mentioned that the white rabbits of the plains usually have their burrows connected, but I can’t figure out which tunnel leads to another burrow and which doesn’t," Applejack replied. Across the stone slab, Fluttershy nodded in agreement.

"Knowing which is the right tunnel would be a great help so we could relocate if there’s an attack," Twilight added.

"Well, if that’s the case, Fluttershy is the pony for the job. We just need to find a white rabbit and introduce it to Fluttershy so it can guide us through the proper path," Rarity said confidently. Twilight nodded, and she and the others turned their attention to Fluttershy.

"Umph... About that... there’s a problem," Fluttershy replied hesitantly, her friends’ gazes fixed on her.

"What’s the problem, Fluttershy?" asked Rarity.

"There’s no one," Fluttershy said, visibly troubled.

"No one?" Rarity and the others echoed, equally baffled.

"Yes, when we checked the area, I noticed there wasn’t a single creature. No rabbits, no birds, no insects, nothing. Everything is silent... It’s as if all the creatures and critters of the plains... have disappeared!" Fluttershy exclaimed, distressed.

Her friends exchanged looks of surprise and concern. Twilight furrowed her brow.

"Are you absolutely sure, Fluttershy? Couldn’t they have just hidden or something?" Applejack asked.

"I don’t think so, Applejack. If the rabbits of the plains wanted to take shelter, they would have come here first since this is their largest burrow," Fluttershy replied, disheartened.

Soon, murmurs filled the room as her friends tried to make sense of this new information. Twilight gently flapped her wings to draw everyone’s attention.

"I don’t know much about this type of magic, but it’s highly likely that when the barrier was cast, it also expelled all the creatures from the meadow. If that’s the case, it’s possible that Vanilla is aware of our individual strengths and decided to exclude anyone who could have helped us," Twilight explained in a serious tone.

However, there was something else that worried her, something she didn’t share with the others. If Vanilla had made such arrangements, then... what had been the purpose of letting the train passengers leave before trapping them? Worse yet, if they were using magic of that caliber... could it be possible that they were being magically spied on at that very moment?

With that lingering concern in her mind, Rainbow Dash suddenly entered through one of the burrow’s entrances, capturing everyone’s attention. Moments earlier, the rainbow-maned pegasus had decided to stay outside as a lookout.

"Did something happen, Rainbow Dash?" Twilight asked as she noticed her friend’s hurried entry.

"Aside from the fact that the beast that’s supposedly meant to be hunting us down right now is taking an afternoon nap... Yeah, I found something else," Rainbow Dash replied.

"What is it?" Twilight could already imagine it wasn’t good news, judging by her friend’s excited expression.

"I think we’re finally going to have to fight someone invisible..." Rainbow Dash exclaimed with a defiant grin, clapping her front hooves together in excitement.
