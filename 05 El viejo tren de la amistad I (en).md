It was a bright and sunny day in Ponyville, a charming town inhabited by various magical creatures: pegasi, unicorns, and earth ponies. At first glance, its residents went about their business as usual during the midday bustle, but this was no ordinary day—it was the highly anticipated "Festival of the Two Sisters." Everywhere, from the houses to the streets, the atmosphere brimmed with excitement and joy, hallmarks of this celebrated occasion. Though it had once been known as the "Summer Sun Celebration," the feelings it stirred in the hearts of ponies remained unchanged.

No one felt it more deeply than Pinkie Pie, who, with her characteristic bouncy and energetic trot, was rushing toward the train station at full speed.

"Take it easy, Pinkie Pie! Don’t go dropping your good cheer along the way!" called out Matilda cheerfully, strolling with her husband, Cranky Doodle, beside the road.

"Never, Matilda! But if I don’t hurry, I’ll miss the train to punctuality! YIIIEP!" Letting out a short neigh, Pinkie Pie picked up her pace, leaving the couple in her pink, bubbly dust.

She wasn’t kidding—she was running late, and breaking a promise with her name on it was the very last thing she intended to do today.

As fast as her legs could carry her, Pinkie Pie burst into the station like a whirlwind of pink energy. She was greeted by an open platform; there was no line to speak of, as everypony was already aboard, waiting for departure.

Entering the station, Pinkie faced her final obstacle: a crowd of ponies in all shapes, sizes, and colors. With her usual exuberance, she weaved her way through the throng, greeting familiar faces and friends with cheerful waves and chirps. Finally, a little out of breath from her own enthusiasm, she arrived at her destination: the door to the special carriage reserved exclusively for important travelers.

She took a deep breath, flashed her widest smile, and flung the door open. The familiar interior of the carriage unfolded before her, revealing her friends waiting inside. There sat Applejack, Rarity, and…

Fluttershy, who gave her a gentle smile upon seeing her. "Hello, Pinkie..."

That was all Pinkie needed. Without a moment's hesitation, she leapt into action, throwing herself at her friend in an exuberant hug.

"FLUTTERSHY, I’VE MISSED YOU SO MUCH!" Pinkie exclaimed between sobs and tears, squeezing Fluttershy with overwhelming enthusiasm.

"There, there, Pinkie… Ughh!" Fluttershy tried to respond, feeling the tight embrace nearly knock the wind out of her.

"A whole season in Mount Aris was too long! I know the baby dolphins needed you, but we needed you here too!" Pinkie continued, shedding even more tears while squeezing Fluttershy with enough enthusiasm to threaten her friend’s ribs.

"I’m sorry, really… I’m sorry… Ughh!" Fluttershy whimpered, noticing how Pinkie’s embrace grew tighter and tighter, to the point of making her change color.

Applejack and Rarity watched the scene unfold with amused smiles. Fluttershy was the second-to-last to arrive, and the three friends had already reunited at the station earlier that morning. But just before Fluttershy’s arrival, Pinkie Pie had dashed off without a word of explanation.

"Well, now we’re just waiting on Rainbow Dash, and we’ll all be here," Applejack remarked, leaning back in her seat.

"Wait, what?! Rainbow isn’t here yet?" Pinkie exclaimed, abruptly letting go of a very squished Fluttershy, who immediately gasped for air as she was freed.

"Nope," Applejack replied casually.

"Could something have happened to her?" Pinkie asked, her expression shifting to genuine concern.

"I don’t think so. She’s—" Applejack began.

"She might’ve had an accident! She might’ve lost her memory! She could’ve fallen into a storm! She might be stuck in another world! She could—"

"Or… she might just be running late," Rarity interjected smoothly, trying to calm her down. "No need to work yourself into a frenzy, darling. You see, Rainbow Dash left Fluttershy a note on her way to the station."

"Huh?" Pinkie tilted her head, blinking in confusion. Her mood quickly shifted from worry to puzzlement, and she wasn’t the only one.

"I thought it was strange too, Pinkie. Rainbow almost never leaves notes," Applejack said, helping Fluttershy sit up before passing her the crumpled piece of paper.

Pinkie unfolded it hastily and found a short message in Rainbow Dash’s unmistakably messy handwriting: “Running late.”

"Hmm… suspicious," Pinkie muttered, narrowing her eyes in an intrigued expression.

"Today’s not the only thing that’s ‘suspicious,’ darling," Rarity said, gesturing toward the bulging saddlebags Pinkie had brought with her.

Pinkie noticed Rarity’s inquisitive look and quickly responded, "Oh… it’s not suspicious at all! It’s a surprise!"

"So that’s why you dashed off the train earlier when we asked what surprise you had planned for Twilight?" Applejack recalled, referencing the moment Pinkie had left the train like a pink projectile.

"Noooo…" Pinkie replied, a bit nervously. "It’s because I thought these trivia rulebooks would be perfect for our train ride!" She pulled out several hefty copies of the book, Official Equestrian Trivia Rulebook, 35th Edition, and handed one to each of her friends with a wide grin.

Rarity and Applejack exchanged skeptical glances before rolling their eyes. While all of Twilight’s friends had gathered for her coronation to help her solve friendship problems across the kingdom, they also took advantage of holidays like this to relax and enjoy each other’s company without worrying about responsibilities. During the "Festival of the Two Sisters," it was tradition for one of them to organize a special activity to honor their dear friend and reigning princess. The chosen friend’s task was to make the gathering as memorable and exciting as possible.

Rarity and Applejack had already taken their turns, leaving Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, and Pinkie Pie next in line.

Setting aside the rulebooks and Pinkie’s peculiar enthusiasm, Rarity decided to handle things with grace. She was the first to speak:

"Darling, I’m sure Twilight would love it if you organized a trivia competition for us…"

"HOW DID YOU KNOW?!" Pinkie exclaimed, her eyes wide with shock.

"Just a hunch," Rarity replied with a quick smile. "But I think you should wait for the drawing before jumping ahead with your plans."

"Besides, we haven’t heard the others’ ideas yet, have we, Fluttershy?" Applejack added, glancing at Fluttershy to encourage her to join the conversation.

"U-um, no," Fluttershy murmured softly, curling up in her seat as she continued to recover from Pinkie’s ‘friendly hug.’

"Do you have something planned too, Fluttershy?" Pinkie asked, leaning in with a curious smile.

"Y-yes…" Fluttershy whispered, growing more timid.

"Would you tell us?" Pinkie pressed, leaning closer.

"Y-yes…" Fluttershy murmured, her voice barely audible as her nervousness intensified.

"Will you tell us… RIGHT NOW?!" Pinkie shouted, leaning so far in that Fluttershy instinctively scooted back into her seat.

"NO!" Fluttershy blurted out with unexpected firmness, straightening up as Pinkie backed away, surprised. "I mean… I’d prefer to wait until after the drawing, if that’s okay with all of you."

Faced with Fluttershy’s firm response, her friends nodded in agreement.

"You’re right, Fluttershy. We have plenty of time to chat during the trip," Rarity said gently as she settled into her seat. "Besides, I’d love to hear all about your adventures in Mount Aris, darling."

Just then, the train’s signature whistle echoed through the air, signaling its imminent departure.

"Oh dear! Rainbow Dash still isn’t here. Do you think the conductor might wait just a little longer?" Fluttershy asked, concern evident in her wide eyes.

"I don’t know, dear. We’re already running quite late today," Rarity replied with a sigh.

"That pony… where in tarnation could she be?" Applejack muttered, casting a quick glance out the window.

"Maybe she’s… up there," Pinkie Pie suggested, her tail twitching in an oddly restless way.

A muffled thud sounded from the roof of the train car, causing everypony to look up in surprise. Moments later, hurried hoofsteps approached the hatch, which burst open to reveal a sky-blue figure with a windswept rainbow mane and a determined stance.

It was Rainbow Dash. As she landed in the car, her anxious gaze darted around the room.

"Rainbow Dash, what do you think you’re—" Applejack began, only to have her sentence cut off when Rainbow Dash firmly pressed a hoof to her mouth.

"Listen, I know this sounds crazy, but we need to lock all the doors and windows. RIGHT NOW!" Rainbow ordered, her tone urgent as she dove under one of the seats.

The others exchanged bewildered looks but didn’t waste any time. Quickly, they secured every corner of the car, shutting all the doors and windows they could find.

"Alright, Rainbow, everything’s locked. Now what’s going—" Applejack’s question was interrupted yet again as a loud thud echoed above their heads.

Cautious hoofsteps crept closer to the roof hatch, the one opening they’d forgotten to close in their rush. Eyes glued to the hatch, the ponies froze, holding their breath.

Inside the dimly lit car, where only faint rays of light filtered through the curtains, everypony watched with growing tension as an unfamiliar nose poked through the hatch, sniffing persistently, as if searching for something.

At that exact moment, the train whistle blared again, and the locomotive began to move. The mysterious figure hesitated for a brief second before vanishing abruptly, seemingly discouraged by the train’s departure.

Once the figure was gone, the ponies collectively exhaled in relief. An awkward silence filled the car, until Rarity finally broke it, voicing what everypony was thinking:

"WHAT IN EQUESTRIA WAS THAT?!"

All eyes turned to Rainbow Dash, who remained half-hidden under the seat, her expression a mix of relief and nervousness.

"It’s… kind of a long story," Rainbow Dash admitted, offering a slightly forced smile as she tried to get comfortable. "Does anypony have a cushion?"
