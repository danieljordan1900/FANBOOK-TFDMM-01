It was a sunny and radiant day in Ponyville, a charming village inhabited by a variety of magical creatures such as pegasi, unicorns, and earth ponies. But this was a special day, as the highly anticipated 'Sisters' Festival' was being celebrated. The atmosphere was filled with enthusiasm and joy, and excitement was palpable in the air. Previously, this day had been known as the 'Summer Sun Celebration', although it had changed its name three years ago, the feeling it evoked in the hearts of all the ponies was the same.

And no one could be more sure of that than Pinkie Pie. With her characteristic energetic trot, she hurriedly made her way to the train station.

"Take care, Pinkie Pie, don't drop your good mood," Matilda cheerfully said as she strolled with her husband Cranky by the roadside.

"Never, Matilda, but if I don't hurry, I'll miss the train of punctuality. YIPEE!" With a short neigh, Pinkie Pie continued on her way, picking up her pace and leaving the couple behind.

It wasn't a joke; Pinkie Pie was running late, and failing a promise that bore her own name was the last thing she wanted to do that day.

Like a pink streak, she arrived at the station, where she was promptly received. There were no ponies waiting outside; everyone was already on the train, waiting for its departure.

Once inside, she was met with a crowd of ponies. Among friends and familiar faces, Pinkie Pie made her way through, greeting everyone she recognized. Finally, she reached a special carriage reserved only for important travelers.

Taking a deep breath and then flashing her best smile, Pinkie Pie swung open the carriage doors where Applejack, Rarity, and...

"Hi, Pinkie..." said Fluttershy.

"FLUTTERSHY, I'VE MISSED YOU SO MUCH!" Pinkie exclaimed amid sobs and tears. In an explosion of overflowing joy, the pink pony threw herself onto her friend who had just greeted her.

"Okay, okay, Pinkie, Ughh!" Fluttershy felt Pinkie's affectionate and vigorous hug all along her back.

"A whole week on Mount Aris was too much. I know the baby dolphins needed you, but WE NEEDED YOU HERE TOO!" Pinkie continued, shedding even more tears.

"I'm sorry, really. I'm sorry. Ughh!" Fluttershy said, and by now her skin was already starting to change color due to the intense hug.

Meanwhile, her friends merely watched the scene with smiles. Fluttershy was the second-to-last to arrive at the gathering. The other three friends had already met that morning at the train station, but it wasn't until shortly before Fluttershy arrived that Pinkie Pie suddenly dashed out without explanations.

"Well, now we just need Rainbow Dash, and we'd all be here," Applejack said.

"Wait! Rainbow hasn't arrived yet?" Pinkie asked in surprise, letting go of a tightly squeezed Fluttershy.

"Nope."

"Could something have happened to her?" Pinkie asked, now looking worried.

"I don't think so, she..." Applejack started to respond.

"She could have had an accident. She could have lost her memory. She could have been kidnapped. She could be sick. They could have been caught in a storm. She could have traveled to another world. She could..."

"Or she could simply be running late," Rarity gently interrupted. "You see, dear, Rainbow Dash left a letter for Fluttershy while she was on her way to the train station."

"Huh?" Pinkie Pie's fluctuating mood was now confused, and she wasn't the only one.

"It seems strange to me too, Pinkie. She hardly ever writes letters," said Applejack, helping a disoriented Fluttershy up from the floor of the carriage. At that moment, she handed her a crumpled piece of paper.

Pinkie Pie unfolded it, revealing her friend's messy handwriting with a single message: "Running late."

"Hmm, suspicious..." Pinkie Pie said with an intrigued look.

"That's not the only 'suspicious' thing today, dear," Rarity replied, having noticed the bulky bags Pinkie had brought along.

Pinkie noticed her gaze and responded, "Oh... it's not suspicious, it's a surprise."

"Was that why you shot out of the train when we asked what surprise you had prepared for Twilight today?" Applejack asked, recalling the moment Pinkie Pie had exited the carriage like a pink projectile.

"Noooo..." Pinkie Pie responded with a mischievous look, "it was because I thought these trivia game rulebooks would be perfect reading material for our train journey," she said as she pulled several bulky copies of the book 'Official Rules of Equestrian Trivia. 35th Edition' from her bags, handing one to each of her friends with a smile.

Rarity and Applejack exchanged a brief suspicious look and simply rolled their eyes. While all of Twilight's friends gathered on the day of her coronation to help her with any friendship problems that might arise in the kingdom, they also used holidays like this to enjoy each other's company without worrying about any particular responsibilities. For this reason, they had agreed that each day of the "Sisters' Festival," one of them would organize a special activity dedicated to their good friend and ruling princess. The friend chosen by drawing lots would be tasked with making the gathering as memorable and exciting as possible.

This challenge had already been taken up by Applejack and Rarity, leaving only the other three friends.

Both ponies set aside the trivia manual.

"Darling, I know Twilight will love you organizing a trivia competition among us..." Rarity began.

"HOW DID YOU KNOW?" Pinkie Pie exclaimed in surprise.

"I guessed," Rarity quickly responded, "but I think you should wait until after the drawing to start with the, uh... preparations."

"Besides, we haven't heard the ideas from the other ponies yet, have we, Fluttershy?" Applejack asked, trying to involve Fluttershy in the conversation.

"Y-yes," Fluttershy timidly replied, seemingly recovered from Pinkie's 'friendly' hug.

"You have something prepared too, don't you, Fluttershy?" Pinkie asked, getting closer with a curious smile toward her friend.

"Y-yes..." Fluttershy responded even more shyly.

"Will you tell us NOW?" Pinkie asked, getting even closer.

"N-NO. I mean, I think I'll wait until after the drawing, if that's okay with you," Fluttershy replied with sudden confidence.

"I agree. We have plenty of time to chat during the journey. Besides, I'd love for you to tell us everything about your trip to Mount Aris, my dear friend Fluttershy," Rarity said as she settled into her seat.

Suddenly, the characteristic sound of the train's whistle echoed, announcing its impending departure from the station.

"Oh, heavens! Rainbow Dash still hasn't arrived. Do you think the train conductor will accept waiting a little longer?" Fluttershy asked.

"I don't know, dear. The train has already been delayed quite a bit today," Rarity replied.

"That pony, where could she be?" Applejack said, looking out the window.

"Maybe she's up above," Pinkie Pie said as her tail began to twitch.

A dull thud resounded on the roof of the carriage. All the ponies looked up, and shortly after, they heard quick footsteps heading toward the roof hatch. It opened, and a cyan pony with a rainbow mane fell out of it.

It was none other than Rainbow Dash, in a firm stance, nervously looking in all directions.

"Rainbow Dash, what do you think you're...?" Before Applejack could finish her question, Rainbow Dash covered her mouth with her hoof.

"Listen, I know it sounds crazy, but you have to close all the doors and windows. NOW!" Rainbow said seriously as she hid under one of the train carriage seats. After exchanging surprised glances, her friends quickly complied with her request. Shortly after, the entire carriage was secured from end to end.

"Alright, Rainbow, what's...?" Once again, Applejack was interrupted by a new thud on the roof. But this time, it was accompanied by a distinct sniffing sound. Stealthy steps were heard slowly making their way to the roof hatch they had forgotten to close.

The ponies looked on with concern as a pony's nose that wouldn't stop sniffing began to emerge from the hatch.

The train whistled once more and started moving.

The mysterious presence seemed to lose interest and quickly departed.

After a moment of silence, it was Rarity who asked the obvious question. "WHAT WAS ALL THAT?"

Applejack and the others turned to Rainbow Dash, who was in an uncomfortable position under a seat.

"It's a bit of a long story. Can someone pass me a cushion?" a tired Rainbow Dash said with a fake smile.
