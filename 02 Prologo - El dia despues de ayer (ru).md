On the blessed island of Cunabula, at the sunset of the Day of Sun Purification, the celebration was in full swing. This day was the most important of the year, and all the inhabitants, regardless of their race or status, participated in one of the purification ceremony activities to show their love for their nation.

The Grand Procession, organized by the Temple Brotherhood, was the most prominent activity of all. Spanning across the entire island, the grand patriarch and the high priests of the temple purified the land of any magical corruption. Other activities took place as well, such as the Purification Bonfire and the Leap of Faith, among others.

However, amidst all the jubilation and celebration, there was a young leopony standing at the highest peak of the island, observing the ceremony unfold. Behind him stood the Sacred Temple, shining with supernatural radiance. Within its walls resided the most powerful magic of the island: the magic of the Harmony Tree. On that day, the magic protected the temple with a blessing, making it impenetrable and amplifying the power of all the island's inhabitants. The temple's glow reflected the people's faith in their kingdom and their patriotism, and this connection concealed and protected them from threats of the outside world.

The young leopony stood at the island's highest peak, his gaze fixed on the celebration taking place below. The sounds of the festivities drifted to him through the wind, and they felt bothersome. The noise contrasted with the sense of sorrow that engulfed him.

In his mind, there was a question tormenting him: How could they be celebrating amidst the crisis they were facing?

He was an apprentice of the Brotherhood of Chivalry, the elite group entrusted with protecting Cunabula from any threat. However, at this moment, the leaders of the Brotherhood, known as the 'Knights of Order,' were not present on the island.

It was unprecedented in the past thousand years, and as one of the most loyal members of the Brotherhood, this deeply disturbed him.

However, it seemed that no one else cared. The celebration continued as if everything was fine. The Grand Patriarch, leader of the Temple Brotherhood and temporarily also of the Brotherhood of Chivalry, made no mention of it in his midday speech. The young leopony sent a letter requesting security reinforcements but only received an invitation to join the Grand Procession, along with a recommendation to spend the day with his family and friends. Of course, he did not accept that response.

He invited his fellow members of the Brotherhood of Chivalry to participate in a vigil for the kingdom. The vigil included the purification fast, a test reserved only for the most devout, consisting of not tasting any food throughout the day with the purpose of purifying the spirit and increasing magical power.

But no one showed up.

The young leopony was alone, accompanied only by his uncomfortable solitude.

No, actually, something else accompanied him: a basket of fruits. His friend Dana, the younger sister of the current king and a member of the Temple Brotherhood, had left it for him before the purification ceremony began. Despite their difference in positions, they got along well and had shared good times at the initiation school. Although they had seen each other less frequently lately, she knew him well enough to know that he would attempt the fast and vigil. Had she left the basket to test his faith or simply because she thought of him?

The young leopony closed his eyes and remained steadfast. He wouldn't let any tears escape. After a moment, he looked back at the basket, and the scent of fresh fruit seemed to fill his senses. His stomach growled.

He remembered the teachings of the Grand Patriarch: "Cleanse your mind, cleanse your spirit from the temptations of this world." However, his stomach continued to rumble.

"I swear, Dana! When the vigil is over, I will savor every last drop of the nectar from this blessed gift," the young leopony promised, lowering his head in resignation.

Suddenly, the young leopony was startled by an unfamiliar aroma carried on a gentle breeze. Something was amiss. He turned his head toward the empty path he had been watching and noticed a hooded figure approaching the temple.

"Halt there!" the leopony roared, alerting the stranger.

The hooded figure took a few more steps and stopped.

The leopony quickly observed them. The individual didn't seem hostile, but his instincts told him not to let his guard down. The stranger's shadow cast upon the ground like a sword, further heightening the leopony's unease.

"Reveal yourself immediately! Concealment is forbidden in this Sacred Temple," the leopony proclaimed, trying not to disrespect any superiors. He had gotten into trouble in the past for "attacking first" and "asking questions later." Where had this individual come from? Teleportation and invisibility were also prohibited. Could this be someone important from the "council"?

The leopony's head began to ache. Fasting had definitely been a bad idea.

"Greetings, little cub. I apologize, but I have come to see the 'Grand Patriarch.' He is an acquaintance of mine, so can you go and fetch him immediately?" a feminine voice spoke, like that of a maiden, but strangely combined with a melodic tone. He had never heard a voice like that among the members of the "council" or anywhere else in the kingdom. That meant...

He was a foreigner. An enemy! Here? Had the moment of reckoning finally arrived? Could he... fight?

He took a deep breath, his doubts fading away, and returned a fierce gaze to the enemy before him.

"No acquaintance of the 'Grand Patriarch' would come as a thief to this sanctuary. Your arrival has not been announced either. Stranger, I will give you one chance. Leave and leave us in peace!" the leopony spoke with all the firmness he could muster, preparing himself for battle.

"Well, this is what we have... You don't even ask for my name? Very well, I'll continue on my way," the hooded figure responded with a calmness that felt like an insult. Unfazed, they continued to advance.

"How arrogant... Take this!" the leopony thought as he launched his first attack.

Three large rocks shot out from the sides of the path. It was an impossible feat for someone as young as him, but thanks to the temple's blessing and the day's fasting, he had accumulated enough magic to carry it out.

However, none of the rocks hit their target.

Instead, the three rocks began to orbit around the hooded figure, who seemed unconcerned by the attack. After a moment, the rocks returned to their original positions.

The leopony stood dumbfounded, unable to believe what he had just witnessed.

"Now, it's my turn," the hooded figure pronounced.

A sudden heat engulfed the leopony's body. A second later, he lost consciousness.

//	--------------------

His head throbbed. He could feel his body swaying in the void, as if someone was carrying him. Everything was confusing. Voices echoed nearby.

Had he died? The voices materialized in his mind. They were moving.

"...you shouldn't fear my lord so much. Activating another tree would surely solve your staffing problem," it was the musical voice he had heard before.

"Cunabula has the situation under control," the Grand Patriarch replied.

A shiver ran through the leopony's body as he recognized the Grand Patriarch's voice. But where was he? A veil seemed to cover his face, and everything was dark. He couldn't move his numbed body. Then he realized it was the Grand Patriarch who was carrying him.

"If you say so," the musical voice continued, lacking respect in its words. "By the way, who is the 'cub'?"

"He is the next king of Cunabula," the Grand Patriarch answered.

"Really? Your 'standards' have lowered... but he's stubborn, at least he meets the minimum requirements to be a king, right?"

The Grand Patriarch didn't respond. Had he noticed that he was listening? Wait... king?

The atmosphere seemed to shift. The leopony felt himself fading away once again.

"Are you really not going to tell me his name?" the musical voice asked again.

"His name is 'Danu'," declared the Grand Patriarch with determination.

After hearing those words, Danu lost consciousness once more.
