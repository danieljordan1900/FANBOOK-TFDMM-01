Tartarus, one hour before the "Festival of the Two Sisters."

Located in one of the most hostile regions of Equestria, this infamous prison holds the kingdom's most dangerous monsters and criminals. Known as the most secure and significant prison, Tartarus consists of a vast network of underground vaults divided into multiple levels and subchambers, all hidden beneath a dark volcanic mountain range. As a grand prison, it has only one way to the outside: a massive, thick double metal door, sealed with magic, serving as an impenetrable barrier to keep its prisoners confined.

Beyond this door, a desolate wasteland with unpredictable weather stretches for miles, giving the landscape an ominous appearance rarely seen in these lands.

With such characteristics, it’s easy to understand why ponies avoid approaching this place, which becomes a source of dread whenever it's mentioned in conversation.

“…escaping from there is impossible!” “…It’s a pit of darkness and evil!” “…there, loneliness will be your only company—and it won’t be your friend!”

These were the kinds of rumors and fears that Tartarus inspired; its name had become synonymous with "unimaginable suffering" for most ponies. Although some understood it was merely a heavily guarded prison and saw no reason to fear it, few thought this way; the majority were deeply convinced otherwise.

However, beyond the mystique and fear surrounding this prison, a very real latent danger existed in that place.

Its prisoners, whose names appeared in witch tales and legends, were real. And it was a relief they were enduring torturous confinement in that site rather than being free outside, causing others to suffer with their “evil deeds.”

At that very moment in the day, in a hidden corner of the prison, a special case of "suffering" was taking place.

Balor of Cunabula, a member of the Knights of Order and the supposed prisoner of Tartarus who bore the Element of Magic, was barely enduring a strange and uncomfortable form of “torture.”

[---]

In a room flooded by banal fog...

"...believe me, darling, you can't imagine the scandal that ensued when Morron found out Raimi had already proposed to me that same day. Of course, I hadn't accepted his proposal and I should've told him so. But seeing him with his feathers scorched was a real DELIGHT," said a voice between splashes.

"Sounds like you’ve got it easy. Let me guess what happened next. Did you two duel to the death?" asked another voice.

"As if they had the guts for that. They both challenged each other to a singing competition," replied the first voice.

Laughter filled the room.

This was a room that shouldn’t exist in that place. It had aromatic candles hanging from the ceiling like chandeliers. The walls were adorned with beautiful colorful reliefs resembling sea waves. Three water ponds were irregularly spaced across the floor, with stone steps to make access easier. There was even a slide leading into the largest pool.

The whole place looked like a luxurious spa house. And in fact, it had been built for that very purpose.

Morrigan and Ceridwen (also Knights of the Order) were chatting in the largest pond. They had begun their bath less than an hour ago. But for Balor, who was in the smallest pond, it felt like days of pointless chatter. Moments like this made the Draco Dragon regret having to free her companions. Of course, it was a childish complaint, and she couldn’t share it with anyone else. However, she really wished that pair of gossiping birds would hurry up and finish their bath and leave.

Submerged up to her nose in the water, Balor clenched her jaw to avoid sighing. She would just have to wait until those two were done so she could continue her purification bath in peace.

"...Well, in the end, my father rejected my suitors. That saved me the trouble of doing it myself. Though I did feel bad for Morron," Morrigan said as she reached for grapes from a basket.

"Really?" asked Ceridwen inquisitively, having just finished polishing the scales of her tail.

"Uhmm... No."

More laughter filled the room. Ceridwen noticed how her Draco Dragon companion was blowing bubbles of annoyance in her pond.

"Well, well, seems like floral soap doesn't really help clean up a bad attitude. Are we interrupting your purification bath, dear friend?"

"Yes, you are," replied a grumpy Balor.

Both Morrigan and Ceridwen looked at each other, confused.

“I thought you did your purification baths in your own room,” Morrigan asked.

“That’s right. But today, I thought I’d try the SPA. After all, I was the one who created it.”

Ceridwen frowned.

“You don’t get ideas like that lightly. Did something happen?” Ceridwen asked seriously.

“Nothing I can tell you.”

“If it’s about Danu, you don’t have to tell us. We already know he asked you to keep an eye on us.”

“Pfft,” Balor scoffed. “He’s only worried about us. You should be more understanding of our leader’s feelings, dear Morrigan.”

Ceridwen laughed at her friend’s sarcasm.

“Oh, I understand exactly how he feels about us. However, why are you defending him?” Morrigan asked.

“Am I?”

“Yes. Just like when you defended his ridiculous three-year plan to defeat the pony princess and her allies. You know it would only take one of us to finish her off in less than five minutes,” Morrigan said, her words laced with veiled contempt and arrogance.

“Ahh, dear Morrigan… I’ll tell you the same thing I told the others. It won’t work. If it were just the pony princess and her friends, even the other princesses, it would be difficult. But you’re forgetting the Lord of Chaos. While he’s with them, we can’t do anything he couldn’t undo. At best, even if we triumphed, that damn draconequus would seek revenge. He’d end up causing some calamity as bad or worse than the one a thousand years ago. Danu isn’t wrong in waiting the three years to be able to use our Harmony Elements and seal him away for good. Besides… any of us? You’re not VERY USEFUL without your puppets.”

“Oh, is that what you think? It’s sad how IGNORANT you are about Urutaú magic.”

“I know enough. Like how useless it is against old healer’s potions.”

“YOU... need a lesson on the true power of my people.” Morrigan said with burning fury, as a black aura surrounded her wings, and her eyes filled with a milky darkness.

“Fine. I’ve never minded learning something new.” Balor replied defiantly, standing up in the pool and extending her webbed arms in a combat stance.

The peaceful SPA filled with tension in an instant.

“ENOUGH!” Ceridwen exclaimed, stepping between them with a long silver staff that she summoned with her magic. “We mustn’t fight each other. Morrigan, Balor. End this unpleasant misunderstanding and apologize.”

The two looked at each other briefly.

“It’s not a misunderstanding,” Morrigan said.

“I agree,” replied Balor.

They returned to their previous positions and resumed their respective baths. No apology had been made, but those last words were the closest thing to one. Minutes of silence passed, until…

“I’m sorry,” Balor said suddenly, her head submerged in the pool up to her neck.

“Sorry, what was that?” Morrigan asked in surprise, as she was checking her feathers.

“I said I’m sorry,” Balor repeated quietly, without looking up or moving.

“I... well, I accept,” Morrigan glanced nervously at Ceridwen, who looked even more surprised than her.

Ceridwen, who had witnessed numerous arguments between her companions, knew that this was the first time since they were named knights that Balor had apologized to Morrigan.

What did that behavior mean? Ceridwen needed to confirm something.

"Ahem... I'm glad you both apologized," Ceridwen said in a casual tone. "By the way, my friend, about what you mentioned earlier—I have a question... Is there really no other way to remove that Lord of Chaos from the picture?"

"Umphhh..." Balor, submerged in her pool, began to ponder. "... there are other ways... we could, for instance, take all the magic from the inhabitants of this realm and use it as a catalyst to capture him. Another option would be to find a magical artifact that could absorb all his chaotic magic. But the problem with these plans is that they attract too much attention or depend too much on the element of surprise. So, in the end... we’re left with our leader’s plan."

Ceridwen nodded, but Morrigan looked unconvinced.

"You're only saying what we already know. Isn’t there anything more? What if we had a truly powerful magical artifact? Something like... a 'Harmony Grace.'"

"You know about that? How?" Balor responded, surprised.

"I'm not as unlearned as you imagine, dear," Morrigan replied, reclining arrogantly on a blanket. "Now, will you answer my question?"

"Only if you tell me what you know." Balor's gaze turned sharp.

For a moment, Ceridwen thought they might start fighting again. And then.

"As you wish... 'friend,'" Morrigan said, dropping her shoulders. "The 'Harmony Graces' are magical weapons of immense power. They were forged from the magic of the Tree of Origin to defeat the darkness that sought to destroy the world. Just one of them grants its bearer tremendous power—power capable of subduing darkness and... chaos. Isn’t that right?"

Balor closed her eyes, as if reflecting on what she would say.

"You’re correct in much of what you’ve said. But you were wrong about one thing. They aren’t weapons meant to defeat or subdue darkness, much less chaos."

"No?" Morrigan now looked confused.

"They are objects that exist to preserve the light of this world. To keep hope alive." Balor paused. "The Great Patriarch... possesses one of these objects."

Ceridwen and Morrigan froze for a moment.

The Great Patriarch...

A title that suited him. He was the oldest being in all of Cunabula. It was said that in his youth, he was part of the tribal leaders who founded the kingdom. Over the centuries, he became the master and leader of the temple brotherhood he himself created. Only after the crisis of the racial wars did he relinquish the temple leadership to the "Chief Primate" and dedicate himself solely to presiding over religious ceremonies. Thus, he earned the title of "Great Patriarch," by which he would be known ever since.

Beyond that, he was also known as the bearer of ancient, powerful magic. While this earned him the admiration of the kingdom’s people as their protector, the wisest among them remained silent. The full extent of the Great Patriarch’s power was a closely guarded secret; his magic was hard to comprehend and impossible to classify. If that wasn’t enough reason to suspect him, his age and past were also a mystery.

No one knew where the Great Patriarch came from... nor his race.

Putting this enigma aside, Balor's words held another.

The Tree of Origin was an ancient entity whose knowledge was more in the realm of lost knowledge than myth. As for the understanding of the 'Harmony Graces,' it was in an even worse state; very few were aware of their existence due to the vast time that had passed since they were last mentioned or seen in the world.

In that case, could it be that the Great Patriarch was indeed the bearer of one of these divine artifacts?

"How old is the Great Patriarch?" Ceridwen seemed to be thinking out loud.

Balor smiled—a question with an answer that amused her greatly.

"He’s around 8,000 years old."

Ceridwen and Morrigan opened their beaks like a pair of hungry fledglings. For Balor, it was a rare opportunity to observe the oral cavity of her companions. On one hand, she had thought the inside of an Urutau bird’s beak would be black. However, it was a bright pink. On the other hand, her Quetzalkan friend seemed to retain her vibrant colors even under her tongue. Mentally, she noted these details. Satisfied that enough time had passed, she continued.

"You shouldn't be so shocked. He's only a bit older than our kingdom."

"ONLY A BIT?" Ceridwen shouted. "CUNABULA HAS A HISTORY OF 2,700 YEARS, AND HE’S LIVED ALMOST THREE TIMES THAT! HOW CAN ANYONE LIVE THAT LONG?"

Balor merely shrugged indifferently.

"So it's true," murmured Morrigan more calmly. "The staff he always carries during purification rituals must be one of those artifacts."

"Yes, that’s right, dear Morrigan. That staff is the Staff of Justice, the first of the 'Harmony Graces' forged millennia ago," said Balor, standing up with a penetrating gaze. "So, my dear friends, might this revelation stay between us?"

Ceridwen and Morrigan exchanged glances. Without a word, they nodded.

"Well, in that case... there's something else I'd like to share with you."

A sudden knock echoed on the main door of the room. A moment later, a mental message reached Balor.

She instantly recognized the visitor. His arrival was not ideal. But... after a few moments of thought, she finally decided to open the door.

Four adult stallions with eyes full of darkness entered, carrying several boxes.

They were led by an unusual-looking young pony. He had grayish-white fur, a light pink mane interrupted by a thick brown curl. Beneath his wavy hair was a severe gaze that contrasted with his gentle colors. But none of that mattered. It was his wings and silver horn that made this pony truly striking.

They stopped a few steps away.

"Squire Badwhiz reporting in. I’ve brought the 'materials' that Lady Ceridwen and Lady Morrigan requested, as well as a message from the Lord Feudal for you, Lord Balor," the pony said, bowing. Immediately, the four stallions placed the boxes on the floor and opened them to reveal their contents.

The 'materials' consisted mainly of personal hygiene items and a few other things.

Ceridwen and Morrigan looked annoyed at the newcomers. But before they could say anything, Balor stepped forward.

"Well, I assume the Lord Feudal requires my immediate presence in his chambers. Am I correct?"

"It is as you say, Lord Balor," Badwhiz replied.

"Well, you heard him. It’s unfortunate, but we’ll have to continue this wonderful conversation another time. Boy, you’re coming with me," she said, as a fleeting fire enveloped her, drying the folds of her skin.

"At your command, my Lord," Badwhiz responded in a disciplined tone.

"Wait! Are you just leaving like that...?" Morrigan exclaimed, but didn’t finish as Ceridwen cut her off.

"Danu and the others should be done with their training. Given their temperament and how things ended last time, wouldn’t it be better if we went with you?"

Balor sighed.

"Let’s leave it at that. Finish your bath and don’t worry. It’s just a report," Balor replied, immediately putting on the traditional skirt of her people and leaving, followed by the young pony.

[---]

In the SPA room, which was now silent, an aura of unease could be felt.

"What do you think he's hiding from us?" Morrigan asked, looking at a thoughtful Ceridwen.

"I'm not sure, but it's not just about Danu." Ceridwen knew Balor much better than the others. In the past, she, Balor, and Taranis had carried out almost all of the missions outside. Throughout those missions, they had come to bond and know each other more deeply. Despite her sarcastic personality, Balor was the highest-level sorceress in the entire kingdom, very clever and unflappable during the most difficult moments of battle. However, that was not what Ceridwen had perceived in her today.

What she perceived was doubt and fear.

"I think we should perform the Purification Fast. What do you think?" Ceridwen suggested.

"Fine by me. I just hope it's worth it," Morrigan replied, ordering the steeds that had been fanning her to leave the room.

A few moments after they left, a golden light filled the room.

[---]

Balor and Badwhiz moved in a straight line through a wide rock passage. Every now and then, they passed by a door or staircase leading to lower levels of the underground complex where they had taken refuge. The entire infrastructure had been built by the Knights of the Order shortly after they freed themselves from their confinement. Later, Balor had made expansions to store prisoners and materials for her experiments.

As she got lost in her thoughts, recalling the use of the rooms on her way, Balor noticed the silence around them.

"That 'boy's' stealth is improving," Balor thought, without looking back.

The 'boy' following her in silence, despite his unusual appearance, was actually a land pony so committed to their cause that even Balor and Morrigan occasionally referred to him as "Mini Danu."

Suddenly, Balor asked, "Tell me, boy, how are the 'decoys' doing?"

"No significant changes since my last report," Badwhiz replied. "Today at sunset, there was a rotation of Equestrian soldiers that was delayed by 15 minutes and 20 seconds, but nothing else relevant happened."

Balor was intrigued. She wasn't sure which was more surprising: the fact that the pony princess still hadn't noticed the fake copies occupying the cells where they should be prisoners or that, among all the ponies in that kingdom, there was someone as fanatical as Badwhiz.

The dragon tilted her head. It was better not to dwell too much on it. There were more important matters to think about, like: "What do you think of the improvements to the armor?"

"It's amazing, Lord Balor!" Badwhiz's eyes shone with excitement. "Now it's really light; it doesn't tire me when I wear it, and it responds immediately to my movements." Badwhiz stretched his metallic wings a little on his back. The movement looked so natural it gave the impression of real Pegasus wings. The control Badwhiz had over them was evident.

"Good, good... but what about the magic?"

"Well... I've been practicing the spells you gave me," Badwhiz stammered a bit. "So far, I've been able to levitate objects and cast healing spells. I still haven't mastered the defense and attack spells... they're difficult... But I'm sure that in a few months I'll have the ability to perform them!" Badwhiz exclaimed, full of confidence.

Balor hid her emotions behind this last statement.

The Alicorn armor she had created with her companions turned out to be more impressive than she had imagined. Originally, it had been given to Badwhiz as a reward for his loyalty. Its true purpose, however, was to keep an eye on him. At that moment, the armor didn't have any magical components; it was simply armor. It was Taranis who suggested that Badwhiz would be more useful if he had the ability to fly or do something else. After a brief discussion among them, and Danu's dismissive agreement, they decided to give him other accessories, like the wings and horn.

Balor herself, however, suggested that they shouldn't create enchanted accessories. Instead, they should make artifacts that would harness the magic of the land pony. This was all part of a low-priority experiment she hadn't carried out yet. Balor didn't believe it would work. Her studies on pony magic showed that the magic of land ponies wasn't compatible with magic from other races of ponies.

However, the reality was different.

Badwhiz had not only learned to fly after an intensive course with Taranis, but he had also started learning magic. Of course, these newly acquired skills were nowhere near those of a true Pegasus or Unicorn. Still, it was remarkable that he had managed to do so in such a short time.

Why did the magic of a land pony work in that armor? Was it the materials she had used that made the difference? Was Badwhiz special, or did all land ponies have that trait? Could any pony acquire a trait from another race? Did the pony princesses know about this and were hiding it? Could Dana have that trait as well?

Balor's mind was filled with all the questions that had arisen from her unexpectedly successful experiment.

"Lord Balor? Are you alright?" The young pony was looking at her.

"No, it's nothing, kid," Balor awkwardly snapped out of her thoughts. "Did something happen?"

"Well, yes. We've arrived, Lord Balor," the confused pony replied.

Before them stood a majestic double stone door. On its surface, the distinctive crest of Cunabula gleamed, engraved in silver. There was no sign of a lock, bolt, or handle to open it. It was evident that this was a magical door, accessible only to those belonging to the exclusive group of knights of the order.

Balor sighed inwardly.

She had been mentally preparing for this moment all day. She just needed Danu to listen to her. Just for a moment, and then she could tell her about...

"Page Badwhiz, I know you already know this, but I'll remind you again. Refrain from speaking. Just follow the instructions I give you. Try not to address the lord unless you're ordered to. Do you understand?"

"Yes, Lord Balor," Badwhiz responded with complete seriousness.

"Good. Let's move on," Balor told herself, repeating the words to boost her confidence. She raised her right claw and cast the spell that opened the door.

The doors creaked like broken bones as they opened. From them emanated vapors mixed with a sulfuric and metallic scent.

The room that lay before them resembled the stomach of a beast.

The doors fully opened, and Balor entered, followed by her loyal Badwhiz.

The spacious vaulted room they had entered rivaled the size of a stable, and at its center was a small waterfall that formed a lagoon. The ceiling was made of stalagmites that emitted a strong amber phosphorescent glow, flooding the entire room with a magical light. In contrast, the floor was completely black and smooth, created with spells to provide comfort to the guests. Only the lagoon in the center broke the oppressive glow of the room, as its own white luminescence shone from the water’s surface, creating the illusion of a fountain full of light.

Balor quickly studied the place. In the heavy atmosphere, there were two bodies at either end of the room, and someone else who seemed to be watching the lake.

She already knew who they were. She walked a certain distance toward the lake and stopped.

"Greetings, lord of the land. Balor, your servant, presents himself in the company of Page Badwhiz."

Danu did not respond. Yes, it was Danu. Her disheveled mane and the wounds on her body were the living image of her current state of mind. They contrasted sharply with the proud image she had shown before leaving Cunabula. Her defeat at the hands of the pony princess had affected her more than her companions had imagined. So much so that she had developed a hatred for the princess and for ponies in general.

Balor understood this part well. She mentally ordered Badwhiz to take the bodies of Taranis and Mannah and bring them to the infirmary to treat their wounds.

Badwhiz obeyed, and with the magic of his horn and a tremendous effort, he left the room, carrying the battered bodies of both knights with him.

The doors closed, and Balor felt the atmosphere lighten.

"You’re giving that pony too many liberties."

"That's right, boss, but it's the most effective method to strengthen his loyalty to us." Balor responded to Danu in a more casual tone. "After all, he will be an important agent who will keep Equestria under our control in the future."

"I’ll decide his importance... What are the other two doing?"

"Morrigan and Ceridwen are enjoying a purifying bath while discussing their noble personas." Balor didn’t hide the sarcasm in her voice.

Danu clicked her tongue.

"Do you think they will betray me?"

"It's unlikely. The day of our revenge is almost here. We are all ready for that moment."

"Everyone? You mean you already have the spell that will destroy the princess and her allies?" Danu spoke to Balor sideways.

"Yes, that's right." Balor replied, inclining herself slightly with a small smile.

Danu also smiled, but it was a wicked smile. Her gaze seemed lost somewhere dark in the room.

Balor noticed the change in her mood. It was dangerous. But this was her best chance.

"My lord feudal, I would like to insist on the proposal I made earlier. Acting tomorrow would give us the opportunity to..."

"ENOUGH! Were my orders not clear to you? WE WILL NOT ATTACK ON A SACRED DAY!" The outburst of rage echoed through the room. Danu was now standing in front of her. She almost seemed like she would attack immediately.

"BUT! MY LORD FEUDAL..." Balor looked directly at her.

"ENOUGH, BALOR! DO YOU ALSO PLAN TO RENOUNCE YOUR PRINCIPLES?" Danu roared.

Balor didn’t respond immediately. But before Danu could continue, she bowed.

"I offer my sincerest apologies, my lord feudal, I went too far, I shouldn’t have insisted on my selfish proposal." Balor replied, with a slight tremor in her wings and tail.

Danu studied her closely, as if measuring the sincerity of her words. Finally, she said:

"I accept your apology. Of the five of us, you have the best understanding of our delicate situation. But don’t think for a moment that your understanding is above mine. Do I make myself clear?" Danu relaxed her stance, but the violence still lingered in her words.

"I am grateful, my lord feudal." A remorseful Balor responded without lifting her head.

"Mph," Danu snorted. She turned her back and slowly entered the lake. Vapors filled the room as the 'leoponi' submerged her body in the water.

After a few minutes, the vapors dissipated, and with them, the tension that had filled the room. The only sound that could be heard was the murmur of the water falling from the small waterfall in the center of the lake.

Suddenly, Danu emerged beneath the waterfall and approached Balor once more.

"Now tell me. How is Cunabula?"

[---]

The clock was almost striking midnight. Reclining on a comfortable, fluffy sofa, Balor reflected on the events of the day in a room dimly lit by the soft glow of candles.

Earlier that morning, she had received a letter from one of her servants in Cunabula, informing her of the unexpected arrival of the Midnight Emissary to the kingdom.

In the afternoon, she had received a report confirming that all the bearers of the Elements of Harmony from the allied nations of Equestria would be attending tomorrow's celebration, something that hadn't happened since her team's defeat.

That evening, she had apologized to Morrigan for the first time in her life.

Finally, she had betrayed Danu by not informing her of what had happened in Cunabula.

She paused her thoughts and asked herself: What will happen next?

One idea after another appeared and disappeared in her mind. Possible scenarios, decisions, and consequences. One after another, until they all led to an inescapable, singular end.

Balor stared at the last mental image that resulted. She hit the sofa so hard that part of its foam broke.

It was the same as the previous ones. She clenched her claws and clicked her tongue. The image faded away.

It was the worst possible outcome, and soon she would live to see it.

Balor had never fully committed to her missions. She had always found some clever or practical solution that brought her success. However, since the defeat against the ponies, a feeling of unease and danger had begun to grow in her mind. How could one solve an unsolvable problem? Balor now faced that dreadful scenario.

She stood up and began to float in the air, assuming a meditation posture.

Once again, she cleared her mind and let go of her fears. But this time, she focused on her family, her home, and her loved ones.

Soon, the image of her sisters Bala and Bila appeared, burning one of their study books. They were young and enjoyed the favor of their parents. Unlike her, they had no aptitude for magic, so they focused only on singing and dancing. Now they were very popular, despite their youth. Although draco dragons weren’t actually dragons. If they took care of themselves, they could have a long life of success, living around 200 years at most.

Balor smiled as she watched her sisters, but suddenly the vision darkened with a terrible thought: would they survive long enough to witness the war that loomed in the future?

She opened her eyes and recalled with annoyance the words the pony princess had said to Ceridwen after their defeat. “There are more important things than home!” she had boldly lectured.

Balor descended to the ground, her gaze filled with great determination. “I won’t let that future happen, I won’t allow it, even if it costs me my own life!” she exclaimed firmly. She had made a decision, and there was no turning back. The plan of Danu and the mission she had been given no longer mattered; everything now boiled down to ensuring the future of her country and, by extension, everyone she loved.

"First, we have to gather everyone. They might not take the truth well, but it’s the path we must follow," she said to herself.

Balor left her room and sent a message to Badwhiz.
