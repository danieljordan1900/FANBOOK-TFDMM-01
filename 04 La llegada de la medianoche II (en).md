Tartarus, one hour before the "Festival of the Two Sisters."

Located in one of Equestria's most hostile regions, this infamous prison, Tartarus, houses the most dangerous monsters and criminals in the kingdom's history. Known as the most important and secure of all prisons, it's geologically formed by a vast network of underground vaults, divided into multiple levels and sub-chambers, all set beneath a dark, volcanic mountain range. It has only one access to the outside: an enormous double metal door, sealed with magic, which serves as an impenetrable barrier to keep its prisoners confined.

Escape is considered impossible, and for any pony with enough common sense, it wasn't hard to imagine the grim life awaiting any unfortunate soul who ended up in such a place.

A life of claustrophobic confinement, accompanied by a soul-crushing solitude that gnawed faster at the spirit than hunger at the body. Day after day seemed to repeat endlessly, surrounded by darkness. The prisoner could only dream of someday waking up from that nightmare.

Without a doubt, every pony shared this opinion. However, at this very moment, in a hidden corner of the prison, another kind of suffering—one unsuspected by all—was taking place.

Balor of Cunabula, a member of the Knights of Order and wielder of the Element of Magic, supposedly a prisoner of Tartarus, was enduring an uncomfortable and unusual “torture.”

“...believe me, darling, you can imagine the scandal Morron caused when he found out Raimi had already proposed to me that same day. Of course, I hadn’t accepted his proposal and should have told him. But seeing him with his feathers all ruffled was just a DELIGHT.”

“Oh, you’ve got it easy. Let me guess what happened next. Did they fight to the death?”

“As if either had the guts for that. THEY CHALLENGED EACH OTHER TO A SINGING CONTEST.”

Laughter filled the room.

This was a room that shouldn’t exist in such a place. It had aromatic candles hanging from the ceiling like chandeliers. The walls were adorned with beautiful, colorful carvings that resembled ocean waves. Three water pools were spaced unevenly on the floor, with stone steps to allow easy access. There was even a slide leading into the largest pool.

The whole place looked like a luxury spa. And, in fact, it had been built for just that purpose.

Morrigan and Ceridwen were chatting in the largest pool. They had started their bath less than an hour ago, but to Balor, who was in the smaller pool, it felt like days of trivial chatter. Moments like these made the Draco Dragon regret having to free her companions. Of course, this was a childish complaint, and she couldn’t share it with anyone else. However, she truly wished that those two gossiping birds would just finish their bath and leave.

Submerged up to her nose in the water, Balor was prepared to wait as long as necessary to continue her purification bath.

"...well, in the end, my father turned down all my suitors. Saved me the trouble of doing it myself. Though, I did feel bad for Morron," said Morrigan as she reached for some grapes from a basket.

"Really?" responded Ceridwen inquisitively, as she finished polishing the scales on her tail.

"Uhmm... No."

More laughter filled the room. Ceridwen noticed how her companion, the Draco Dragon, was blowing bubbles in her pool.

“Well, well, it seems the floral soap really doesn’t wash away bad temper. Are we interrupting your purification bath, dear friend?”

“Yes, you are,” replied a grumpy Balor.

The two of them looked at each other, puzzled.

“I thought you did your purification baths in your own room,” Morrigan asked.

“That’s right. But today, I thought I’d try the SPA. After all, I was the one who created it.”

Ceridwen frowned.

“You don’t get ideas like that lightly. Did something happen?” Ceridwen asked seriously.

“Nothing I can tell you.”

“If it’s about Danu, you don’t have to tell us. We already know he asked you to keep an eye on us.”

“Pfft,” Balor scoffed. “He’s only worried about us. You should be more understanding of our leader’s feelings, dear Morrigan.”

Ceridwen laughed at her friend’s sarcasm.

“Oh, I understand exactly how he feels about us. However, why are you defending him?” Morrigan asked.

“Am I?”

“Yes. Just like when you defended his ridiculous three-year plan to defeat the pony princess and her allies. You know it would only take one of us to finish her off in less than five minutes,” Morrigan said, her words laced with veiled contempt and arrogance.

“Ahh, dear Morrigan… I’ll tell you the same thing I told the others. It won’t work. If it were just the pony princess and her friends, even the other princesses, it would be difficult. But you’re forgetting the Lord of Chaos. While he’s with them, we can’t do anything he couldn’t undo. At best, even if we triumphed, that damn draconequus would seek revenge. He’d end up causing some calamity as bad or worse than the one a thousand years ago. Danu isn’t wrong in waiting the three years to be able to use our Harmony Elements and seal him away for good. Besides… any of us? You’re not VERY USEFUL without your puppets.”

“Oh, is that what you think? It’s sad how IGNORANT you are about Urutaú magic.”

“I know enough. Like how useless it is against old healer’s potions.”

“YOU... need a lesson on the true power of my people.” Morrigan said with burning fury, as a black aura surrounded her wings, and her eyes filled with a milky darkness.

“Fine. I’ve never minded learning something new.” Balor replied defiantly, standing up in the pool and extending her webbed arms in a combat stance.

The peaceful SPA filled with tension in an instant.

“ENOUGH!” Ceridwen exclaimed, stepping between them with a long silver staff that she summoned with her magic. “We mustn’t fight each other. Morrigan, Balor. End this unpleasant misunderstanding and apologize.”

The two looked at each other briefly.

“It’s not a misunderstanding,” Morrigan said.

“I agree,” replied Balor.

They returned to their previous positions and resumed their respective baths. No apology had been made, but those last words were the closest thing to one. Minutes of silence passed, until…

“I’m sorry,” Balor said suddenly, her head submerged in the pool up to her neck.

“Sorry, what was that?” Morrigan asked in surprise, as she was checking her feathers.

“I said I’m sorry,” Balor repeated quietly, without looking up or moving.

“I... well, I accept,” Morrigan glanced nervously at Ceridwen, who looked even more surprised than her.

Ceridwen, who had witnessed numerous arguments between her companions, knew that this was the first time since they were named knights that Balor had apologized to Morrigan.

What did that behavior mean? Ceridwen needed to confirm something.

"Ahem... I'm glad you both apologized," Ceridwen said in a casual tone. "By the way, my friend, about what you mentioned earlier—I have a question... Is there really no other way to remove that Lord of Chaos from the picture?"

"Umphhh..." Balor, submerged in her pool, began to ponder. "... there are other ways... we could, for instance, take all the magic from the inhabitants of this realm and use it as a catalyst to capture him. Another option would be to find a magical artifact that could absorb all his chaotic magic. But the problem with these plans is that they attract too much attention or depend too much on the element of surprise. So, in the end... we’re left with our leader’s plan."

Ceridwen nodded, but Morrigan looked unconvinced.

"You're only saying what we already know. Isn’t there anything more? What if we had a truly powerful magical artifact? Something like... a 'Harmony Grace.'"

"You know about that? How?" Balor responded, surprised.

"I'm not as unlearned as you imagine, dear," Morrigan replied, reclining arrogantly on a blanket. "Now, will you answer my question?"

"Only if you tell me what you know." Balor's gaze turned sharp.

For a moment, Ceridwen thought they might start fighting again. And then.

"As you wish... 'friend,'" Morrigan said, dropping her shoulders. "The 'Harmony Graces' are magical weapons of immense power. They were forged from the magic of the Tree of Origin to defeat the darkness that sought to destroy the world. Just one of them grants its bearer tremendous power—power capable of subduing darkness and... chaos. Isn’t that right?"

Balor closed her eyes, as if reflecting on what she would say.

"You’re correct in much of what you’ve said. But you were wrong about one thing. They aren’t weapons meant to defeat or subdue darkness, much less chaos."

"No?" Morrigan now looked confused.

"They are objects that exist to preserve the light of this world. To keep hope alive." Balor paused. "The Great Patriarch... possesses one of these objects."

Ceridwen and Morrigan froze for a moment.

The Great Patriarch...

A title that suited him. He was the oldest being in all of Cunabula. It was said that in his youth, he was part of the tribal leaders who founded the kingdom. Over the centuries, he became the master and leader of the temple brotherhood he himself created. Only after the crisis of the racial wars did he relinquish the temple leadership to the "Chief Primate" and dedicate himself solely to presiding over religious ceremonies. Thus, he earned the title of "Great Patriarch," by which he would be known ever since.

Beyond that, he was also known as the bearer of ancient, powerful magic. While this earned him the admiration of the kingdom’s people as their protector, the wisest among them remained silent. The full extent of the Great Patriarch’s power was a closely guarded secret; his magic was hard to comprehend and impossible to classify. If that wasn’t enough reason to suspect him, his age and past were also a mystery.

No one knew where the Great Patriarch came from... nor his race.

Putting this enigma aside, Balor's words held another.

The Tree of Origin was an ancient entity whose knowledge was more in the realm of lost knowledge than myth. As for the understanding of the 'Harmony Graces,' it was in an even worse state; very few were aware of their existence due to the vast time that had passed since they were last mentioned or seen in the world.

In that case, could it be that the Great Patriarch was indeed the bearer of one of these divine artifacts?

"How old is the Great Patriarch?" Ceridwen seemed to be thinking out loud.

Balor smiled—a question with an answer that amused her greatly.

"He’s around 8,000 years old."

Ceridwen and Morrigan opened their beaks like a pair of hungry fledglings. For Balor, it was a rare opportunity to observe the oral cavity of her companions. On one hand, she had thought the inside of an Urutau bird’s beak would be black. However, it was a bright pink. On the other hand, her Quetzalkan friend seemed to retain her vibrant colors even under her tongue. Mentally, she noted these details. Satisfied that enough time had passed, she continued.

"You shouldn't be so shocked. He's only a bit older than our kingdom."

"ONLY A BIT?" Ceridwen shouted. "CUNABULA HAS A HISTORY OF 2,700 YEARS, AND HE’S LIVED ALMOST THREE TIMES THAT! HOW CAN ANYONE LIVE THAT LONG?"

Balor merely shrugged indifferently.

"So it's true," murmured Morrigan more calmly. "The staff he always carries during purification rituals must be one of those artifacts."

"Yes, that’s right, dear Morrigan. That staff is the Staff of Justice, the first of the 'Harmony Graces' forged millennia ago," said Balor, standing up with a penetrating gaze. "So, my dear friends, might this revelation stay between us?"

Ceridwen and Morrigan exchanged glances. Without a word, they nodded.

"Well, in that case... there's something else I'd like to share with you."

A sudden knock echoed on the main door of the room. A moment later, a mental message reached Balor.

She instantly recognized the visitor. His arrival was not ideal. But... after a few moments of thought, she finally decided to open the door.

Four adult stallions with eyes full of darkness entered, carrying several boxes.

They were led by an unusual-looking young pony. He had grayish-white fur, a light pink mane interrupted by a thick brown curl. Beneath his wavy hair was a severe gaze that contrasted with his gentle colors. But none of that mattered. It was his wings and silver horn that made this pony truly striking.

They stopped a few steps away.

"Squire Badwhiz reporting in. I’ve brought the 'materials' that Lady Ceridwen and Lady Morrigan requested, as well as a message from the Lord Feudal for you, Lord Balor," the pony said, bowing. Immediately, the four stallions placed the boxes on the floor and opened them to reveal their contents.

The 'materials' consisted mainly of personal hygiene items and a few other things.

Ceridwen and Morrigan looked annoyed at the newcomers. But before they could say anything, Balor stepped forward.

"Well, I assume the Lord Feudal requires my immediate presence in his chambers. Am I correct?"

"It is as you say, Lord Balor," Badwhiz replied.

"Well, you heard him. It’s unfortunate, but we’ll have to continue this wonderful conversation another time. Boy, you’re coming with me," she said, as a fleeting fire enveloped her, drying the folds of her skin.

"At your command, my Lord," Badwhiz responded in a disciplined tone.

"Wait! Are you just leaving like that...?" Morrigan exclaimed, but didn’t finish as Ceridwen cut her off.

"Danu and the others should be done with their training. Given their temperament and how things ended last time, wouldn’t it be better if we went with you?"

Balor sighed.

"Let’s leave it at that. Finish your bath and don’t worry. It’s just a report," Balor replied, immediately putting on the traditional skirt of her people and leaving, followed by the young pony.
