Within the great barrier where Twilight and her friends were trapped, a heavy calm prevailed. A haunting stillness was interrupted only by the lethargic crowing of the Cocatriz Titanicus, the sole visible creature in the vast, desolate plain.

However, on one edge of the horizon, another presence moved imperceptibly beneath the white sky of the barrier.

Barely noticeable even to the most trained eye, this invisible figure subtly distorted the light around it as it glided slowly over the meadow.

Gradually, like a breeze from an imaginary wind, the translucent figure descended near a hill surrounded by dry, scattered shrubs.

It advanced with steps so subtle that no sound betrayed its presence: no crunching of dry leaves beneath its hooves, no rhythm of its breath.

This was how stealthy Badwhiz Starheart had become—a young earth pony clad in alicorn armor, driven by the twists of fate into this strange and dark destiny.

With silent movements, he crept within mere meters of the entrance to the rabbit burrow where Twilight and her friends had taken refuge.

Protected by the magical enchantment that kept him hidden from the world, Badwhiz watched confidently.

Finding this place had been simple. From the moment the princess and her allies ascended the hill, he had been observing them from a distance. During that time, he remained vigilant, circling invisibly around the area, like an eagle stalking its prey.

The initial orders he had received were clear: monitor the movements of the princess and her allies. However, he knew those instructions could change at any moment, and that was precisely what happened. Now he had a new mission: infiltrate the princess’s base of operations and uncover what she and her pesky friends were planning.

"What a troublesome mare! How could they make her a princess?" Badwhiz thought, feeling a surge of disdain.

He despised Twilight. He despised what she represented and what she was doing to the kingdom his ancestors had sworn to protect. To him, Equestria had always been a kingdom of earth ponies, pegasi, and unicorns—a realm that symbolized balance among the three races. But since Twilight ascended to the throne, all of that had begun to change.

Creatures from distant lands started arriving, living alongside ponies, transforming their customs, cities, and even their celebrations. Slowly, the unique identity of ponies was eroding, dissolving into a blend of cultures that, in his view, would eventually destroy the foundations of unity among the races.

Over time, no one would remember why ponies had united in the first place, and then the terrible wheel of conflict would begin to turn.

However, in his mind, this was merely the least of that princess’s sins.

What she had done with the Trees of Harmony... and what was yet to come.

The awakening of darkness.

Badwhiz closed his eyes for a moment, letting the memories of Balor’s words and those of the other knights weigh heavily on his soul.

He was the only pony who knew the truth. The last of the Starhearts still alive in this world. He would walk the same path as his ancestors, for that was his destiny: to protect Equestria at any cost.

Opening his eyes once more, he continued watching patiently until he finally received the confirmation he had been waiting for. The voice resonated telepathically in his mind, clear and precise:

"Proceed, child. It’s safe."

Following the command, Badwhiz entered the burrow.

After a swift and imperceptible trot, Badwhiz arrived in a wide, empty chamber. The ceiling was adorned with luminous crystals, their light falling perfectly onto the leaf chairs and stone table at its center.

"The rabbits of Equestria certainly have a good sense of interior decoration," said a new mental voice within Badwhiz.

"I doubt it, my dear Taranis. This is undoubtedly the work of that frivolous pony who accompanies that cowardly princess. We should purge this place so they have no refuge to return to," another voice replied.

"Please, Morrigan. Stick to the plan. Child, continue the exploration."

"As you command, Lord Mannah," Badwhiz responded mentally.

Without wasting any more time, the pony began inspecting the room. Soon, he discovered that the lower parts of the walls were riddled with holes of various sizes. Using the light from his horn, he observed that these holes led to other tunnels descending deeper into the ground. Some even branched off in multiple directions. However, most of them were small and too narrow for an adult pony to pass through.

Badwhiz completed a full circuit of the room, finishing his inspection. Aside from the recently added decorations on the walls and other traces of civilization, he found no further signs of the mares who had been there. The princess and her allies had left their refuge very recently. The reasons behind this decision were unclear. Nor was it known what method they had used to leave. They could have taken one of the larger tunnels or used teleportation.

There wasn’t enough information.

"Child, that’s enough for now. Leave the area and inspect the surroundings," Mannah commanded, and Badwhiz confirmed the order as he exited the burrow.

It was a prudent decision; he needed more clues.

Once outside, nothing had changed. Without a clear direction, the invisible Badwhiz began trotting toward the left side of the hill, carefully observing his surroundings, hoping to find some trace left behind by those ponies.

He had barely taken a few steps among the bushes when...

"Whiuuzzzz," a sharp whistling sound exploded at his side. Badwhiz instinctively stepped back and immediately raised a magical barrier for protection.

Tiny fragments of confetti fell around him, accompanied by the remains of decorative party streamers.

Agitated and with his heart pounding from the sudden attack, Badwhiz stood still for a few seconds. He had made a mistake: by releasing his magic, he broke his invisibility and was now completely exposed. He sharpened all his senses as much as he could, trying to detect any enemy nearby. However, he found nothing. Only silence.

Still wary, he glanced at the spot where he had been standing moments before. On the ground, covered in confetti and colorful ribbons, lay the remains of a surprise capsule that had been hidden among the grass.

"Is something wrong, child?" asked a familiar voice in Badwhiz's mind.

"No, nothing. Just a ridiculous trap," replied the armored pony, striving to regain his composure.

"Continue," the voice ordered coldly.

Badwhiz dissipated the barrier and, now calmer, approached the remnants of the tiny capsule. He stared at it with annoyance, unable to suppress his frustration at the frivolous trap that had momentarily stopped him.

"Stupid mares. Is wasting time the only thing they’re good at?" he muttered aloud, kicking the confetti capsule remnants disdainfully—Pinkie Pie's handiwork.

"Some of us, maybe. But it sounds so rude when you put it that way..." a mocking voice responded from the bushes.

Badwhiz barely had time to process the words. A dull blow struck his head, clouding his vision. Pain surged through his skull as a sense of weightlessness enveloped him. Acting on pure instinct, he tried to extend his wings, but something held him immobile.

When his vision finally cleared, he realized he was tied up on the ground. Above him, a cyan-coated pegasus with a rainbow-colored mane looked down at him with a triumphant smile.

"... I’d say they prefer living with style. You should try it someday," Rainbow Dash said in a casual tone.

"YOU!" Badwhiz exclaimed, trying to concentrate and attack her with his horn’s magic. But nothing happened. Perplexed, he tried again, with the same result.

"Heh," Rainbow Dash said, raising a hoof with an air of superiority. "Looking for these? Or maybe these?"

In her hoof, she held two crucial objects: the Starheart gem and the alicorn horn circlet that were part of Badwhiz’s armor.

"HOW?" Badwhiz asked in disbelief, unable to take his eyes off the items.

"I swiped them. Great pirate trick, huh?" Rainbow Dash responded with a smug grin.

"BUT... THEY WERE BOUND TO ME WITH MAGIC!" Badwhiz roared, filled with rage.

"HA! That’s why I said it’s a great pirate trick! Spend a season with those guys out at sea, and you end up becoming one of them. Ha, ha... good times!" the pegasus said, letting out a wistful sigh as she looked off into the distance.

Her expression suddenly changed. Rainbow Dash turned back to Badwhiz, her good mood vanishing in an instant.

"By the way, about what you said about my friends earlier..."

She stepped closer until she was standing directly in front of him. Lowering her head, she leaned in until her eyes were level with his.

"WE’RE NOT STUPID, KID," she said slowly, her voice heavy with menace, pressing her hoof against Badwhiz's chin.

"I don’t care. That won’t change—"

"Yeah, yeah, let’s just wrap this up," Rainbow Dash interrupted. With a flap of her wings, she lifted into the air and grabbed one end of the rope she had tied Badwhiz with, beginning to drag him through the bushes.

Badwhiz started struggling to free himself from the bindings, but his efforts were futile. The ropes, knotted with a solid Apple family triple knot, didn’t budge at all. After being dragged several meters by Rainbow Dash, they reached the rocky summit of the hill.

"You know, I’m a little disappointed in you. For being the Seventh Knight of the Fools, you’re quite the showman. Or is it because your other pals are out there trying to free that band of pseudo-knights from their cage?" the pegasus asked, but Badwhiz only responded with a cold glare. "Well, whatever. I’m sure you’ll enjoy a long chat with Pinkie Pie once we’re done here."

"It’s not over yet. You won’t be able to defeat the mighty Cocatriz Titanicus," Badwhiz responded defiantly.

"Oh, right... that giant bird thing. Why don’t you take a look over here, kid?" Dash said, pulling Badwhiz along to stand beside her and look out at the horizon where the train and the fearsome beast were located.

What Badwhiz saw next was so hard to believe that he thought he was dreaming.

In the distance, the Cocatriz Titanicus was unleashing a fiery ray at what appeared to be a purple pegasus flying around it. Beside her, other ponies were attacking it with rocks and various projectiles. That was undoubtedly the pony princess and her allies fighting the beast. As expected, their efforts were causing no harm to the powerful Cocatriz Titanicus, which continued spewing fire and sending gusts of wind with its wings.

But something wasn’t right. Gradually, the great creature’s ferocious movements became slower and slower. Almost paralyzed, the Cocatriz Titanicus tried to shake off a strange pink-and-yellow collar around its neck, but it was in vain. The creature’s body wavered, letting out one final breath. Like a felled tree, it toppled over, burying its beak into the charred plain.

Badwhiz was stunned, staring at the final result of the brief battle. Beside him, Rainbow Dash scratched her head, more puzzled than surprised.

"Huh. Its chin was its weak point? Really?" Rainbow Dash said. Then she turned to Badwhiz, who was still in shock. "Don’t ask me what just happened. I don’t get it either. Anyway... let’s get going to meet the girls."

The rainbow-maned pegasus tucked Badwhiz’s gem and circlet somewhere into her mane and prepared to depart.

[---]

Several minutes earlier, in the burrow...

"Wait... did you say invisible?" Rarity asked, surprised and slightly frightened.

"Yep, he’s been circling above us for a while," Rainbow Dash replied cheerfully, increasing the air of unease that hung around the stone table.

"Rainbow Dash, you said he was... what is he doing now?" Twilight asked, trying to keep calm.

"Coming this way, of course," the pegasus answered with a nonchalant tone that almost seemed like a challenge.

Twilight was alarmed. Vanilla already knew where they were, and now he was coming for them. And she still hadn't explained about the Cocatriz Titanicus or the possible identity of Vanilla. This was bad. In the past, Twilight would have been on the floor having a panic attack. And certainly, a part of her still felt inclined to do that at this moment. However, those three years of constant stress and procrastinated tasks had toughened her enough to handle such a complicated situation.

With a deep sigh and making a mental effort, Twilight closed her eyes, cleared her mind, and envisioned the best courses of action she should take, using the little information they had gathered so far. After a few seconds, she opened her eyes, finally figuring out what needed to be done.

Without paying attention to her friends’ gazes, Twilight stood up and created a protective magic bubble around them.

"This place is no longer safe. I’m sorry, Rarity, but we’ll have to leave," Twilight said apologetically to her friend.

"It’s fine, Twilight. I just hope the prairie rabbits will enjoy this home more than we did," Rarity replied with regret.

"And what about this bubble?" Pinkie Pie asked, placing her helmet on the walls of the magical barrier.

"Vanilla already knows our position, and he’s probably been watching us with magic since the moment we arrived here. If he didn’t take action before, it was because he was cautious about what we might do. After observing us enough, he must be sure that we’re not a threat, and he’s decided to take the initiative. This barrier will prevent him from continuing to observe us," Twilight explained as her expression grew more serious.

"So that Vanilla thinks we’re not a threat? Well, let him keep thinking that. We’ll show him that we’re not just defenseless ponies," Applejack said. All the other ponies stood up, emboldened by her words, except Fluttershy, who remained somewhat uncertain in her seat.

"I agree, Applejack, but it won’t be here where we show him," Twilight said, keeping her calm as she looked at them all.

"Really?" Rainbow Dash replied, looking slightly disappointed.

"Yes, Rainbow Dash. If we fight here, we’ll fall into the scenario that Vanilla must have prepared. Right now, we need to go to a new shelter and prepare."

"Isn’t that what we’ve already done?" Pinkie Pie asked, peeking her head behind Fluttershy.

"Yes, but now I have a plan," Twilight responded with a smile. Seeing the confidence in her princess friend, they all began to calm down. "I know how to quickly defeat the Cocatriz Titanicus, and thanks to Rainbow Dash, we know Vanilla is coming this way. This is a good opportunity to surprise him separately. The first thing we need to do is move to a new refuge. I’ll use teleportation for that, and I’ll explain the rest when we get there."

Upon hearing Twilight’s explanation, everyone agreed and began gathering around her, preparing for the teleportation. However, Rainbow Dash stayed where she was, watching them with narrowed eyes. Twilight could already imagine what her daring friend had in mind, as she too had seen that scenario.

"Wait, Twilight," the pegasus finally said.

"What’s going on, Rainbow Dash?" Twilight asked, hiding her pain.

"I have a better idea. I’ll stay. I’ll fight Vanilla here," Rainbow Dash said with a serious look.

"Huh?" All the ponies, except Twilight, exclaimed in unison.

"WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, RAINBOW?!" Applejack exclaimed first, facing the pegasus.

"What you heard, Applejack. I’ll stay and fight Vanilla while you all defeat that Cocatriz Titanicus. That way, we’ll have a better chance of winning," Rainbow Dash responded, completely calm.

"NOW ISN’T THE TIME TO PLAY THE HERO. WE’RE SUPPOSED TO BE UNITED TO..."

"What Rainbow Dash says is right, Applejack," Twilight said, supporting Rainbow Dash’s words. Her friends looked worried, especially Applejack.

"But, Twilight?!" Applejack appealed.

"I know it’s a tough decision. But now that we know Vanilla is alone, this might be our best chance to defeat him. Given the countermeasures our opponent has taken so far, he probably expects us to act together. If Rainbow Dash attacks him separately while we face the Cocatriz Titanicus, it will increase our chances of success. However..." Twilight said, turning to her friends who were surrounding her and then to Rainbow Dash, "... Rainbow Dash, you don’t need to face him without reservations. It will be enough for you to distract him while we deal with the Cocatriz Titanicus. Do you understand?"

"Of course! I’m not going to charge at him like a runaway cart. But if that Vanilla turns out to be some kind of show-off, don’t blame me if I finish before you all," Rainbow Dash replied confidently. Twilight knew how much her pegasus friend liked to boast, but seeing her firm posture and serious look, she knew that in that moment, Rainbow Dash wasn’t bragging.

"Alright, if that’s the case... now I’d like to know who’s in favor of Rainbow Dash’s idea," Twilight asked the rest of the ponies.

They all fell silent. It was undeniable that their athletic pegasus friend was the best flyer in all of Equestria and that she had gained even more experience on her journey around the world. If there was a pony capable of facing Vanilla alone, it was Rainbow Dash.

Unable to deny the truth, and with clear concern, each of the ponies raised one of their hooves. Even Applejack did, although with great discomfort.

Twilight nodded, bringing the discussion to an end. On the other side, Rainbow Dash stood with an even firmer and more confident posture than before. "Thanks, girls, I won’t let you down."

"Rainbow, don’t do anything foolish. If that guy starts doing weird, evil things, come back to us immediately," Applejack warned. Behind her, the rest of the ponies shared similar words.

"Please, girls. I’ll be fine! I’ve fought scarier things than a cranky kid. In fact... it’s you guys I’m worried about. Are you really ready for this?"

"I have a plan, Rainbow Dash. And I’d like to share it with everyone now, but we don’t have the time for that," Twilight said, looking warily at the main entrance of the burrow.

"I understand... if that’s the case," Rainbow Dash said, starting to walk toward the entrance.

"Wait, Rainbow," at that moment, Twilight’s horn lit up. From the alicorn’s mane emerged a tiny white crystal that levitated to the center of the table. It was then imbued with Twilight’s magic until it took on a brilliant sky-blue color, almost as if it were a precious gem. The enchanted crystal, shaped like a wing, continued its journey until it reached Rainbow Dash’s hooves.

"What’s this?" Rainbow Dash asked, somewhat intrigued.

"I’ve placed a special magic in this crystal that will give you the ability to become invisible and imperceptible for long periods of time. However, the magic won’t completely hide your presence, and it will also be less effective the faster you move," Twilight explained as Rainbow Dash started playing with the magic of the crystal, appearing and disappearing with brief flickers.

"Wow, awesome, Twilight! Since when are you able to do stuff like this?" Rainbow Dash asked as the other ponies murmured, surprised by the amazing magic of the crystal.

"This year. I was invited to the seminar on innovative applications of transmutational magic in inanimate bodies at the School of Magic. You’d be surprised at the huge breakthroughs Estigia and Star Swirl are making in this field of magic. And also..." Twilight froze, her friends, especially Rainbow Dash, were watching her with smiles. Despite her urgent readiness to leave immediately to avoid being ambushed by Vanilla, she had just started talking about academic topics that weren’t appropriate for the situation they were in.

"Ahem," Twilight cleared her throat. "Please, be very careful, Rainbow. And pay close attention to the pink gem that Vanilla has on his neck," the alicorn said with a look that reflected her worry, as well as that of her friends. Twilight’s horn began to gather magic to use the teleportation spell that would take them away from there.

"I’ll keep that in mind. And don’t worry so much. I know how to take care of myself," Rainbow Dash replied with her typical grin.

"BE CAREFUL, RAINBOW DASH!" Pinkie Pie shouted, unable to contain herself any longer. The pink pony jumped to hug her friend one last time. However, Twilight’s magic was cast at that moment, and the five ponies disappeared in a burst of light. At the same time, the protective magical bubble around them vanished.

Behind, Rainbow Dash had already activated the crystal. The pegasus stood, looking at the empty space where her friends had been. A thought suddenly came to her. That very afternoon, she had thought of leaving them behind for some ridiculous mess she had gotten into. If she had done that... what would have been happening to her friends right now?

A shadow crossed Rainbow Dash’s gaze. The pegasus shook her head, trying to shake off those dark thoughts. There was no point in thinking about ‘maybe’ or ‘what could have been.’ She had to focus on the ‘now.’ And now, her friends needed her focused and ready to face the enemy who had sworn to destroy them. Almost as if hearing an imaginary audience, Rainbow Dash raised one hoof with her eyes closed. Immediately, all mental noise ceased. With a long exhale, her senses sharpened, and her body entered a state of concentration, ready for combat.

"Come on, get closer, mister... I’m waiting for you!" the pegasus told herself. With a leap, she reached the ceiling of the burrow and clung to the exposed branches, almost like a spider. With a gaze fixed on the entrance of the burrow, Rainbow Dash was 100% ready to face whatever came her way, intending to harm her or her friends.
