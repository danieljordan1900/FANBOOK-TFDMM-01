On the island of Cunabula, about two hours before the start of the Day of Solar Purification, a lightly armored leopony observed, from the island’s highest peak, the preparations to celebrate the most important day of the year.

It was Dana of Cunabula, the younger sister of King Dal, holding the title of 'Primado' of the 'Temple Brotherhood.' As Primado, she was responsible for accompanying the Grand Patriarch throughout the Grand Procession, being present at the King’s midday speech, and leading the closing address, among other duties.

Despite her overwhelming list of duties, none of these responsibilities caused her any discouragement; quite the opposite, they provided her with a true sense of purpose and fulfillment. Dana loved her work, loved Cunabula, and ever since she was a cub, she had always awaited this special day with a smile.

However, this time, the situation was tense. An extraordinary event had been announced, something that hadn’t happened in over a thousand years: the official arrival of a foreigner to Cunabula.

The King, the Council, and the general population—including Dana herself—received the news with surprise and fear. And it was no wonder, as it was the Grand Patriarch who made the announcement during an emergency Council meeting the day before, without giving any further explanations.

No one on the island knew who the foreigner was or why they were being received. Only a select group, including the Grand Patriarch and the King, knew the stranger’s identity.

However, the most crucial part was not discovering the foreigner’s identity, but understanding the purpose of their arrival.

Dana closed her eyes and uttered a prayer for the kingdom. It was all she could do at that moment, still clinging to the faint hope that everything would turn out well...

"Excuse me, Primado Dana. The preparations for the welcoming ceremony are complete," someone suddenly spoke from behind her. Dana turned around and saw one of her fellow members of the 'Temple Brotherhood,' bowed in a posture of reverence. Dana sighed quietly; her prayer had been interrupted, but she didn’t take it personally, as she had previously ordered him to inform her immediately when everything was ready.

"Come with me. I’ll review the work you’ve prepared," Dana replied solemnly. Without wasting another second, they both headed toward the temple.

In front of the grand temple of the Tree of Harmony, a small crowd of members from the 'Brotherhood of Cavalry' and the 'Temple Brotherhood' had gathered. Members of the 'Brotherhood of Cavalry' had split into six squads of six members each, formed into three groups on either side of the welcoming carpet. Each squad represented one of the six principal houses of Cunabula: House Draco Dragon, House Quetzalkan, House Urutau, House Ophiotaurus, House Akhtubut Qirshin, and lastly, House Leopony. Additionally, there were regular soldiers posted around the temple perimeter and a small number of 'Temple Brotherhood' members waiting on the other side of the welcoming carpet.

Dana quickly reviewed the formations. Along her way, she paused a few times to assess the soldiers' discipline, the cleanliness of the area, the lighting, and the decorations. Finally, she ascended the highest steps of the temple and nodded in satisfaction.

"Good job. That will be all for now. You may return to your assigned duties," Dana said with satisfaction.

"Thank you very much," the leopony assistant replied. He bowed respectfully and hurriedly withdrew from her presence.

From the temple’s portico, Dana observed all those present before her, while the crowd, in turn, watched her closely, awaiting her orders.

Dana sighed, feeling somewhat insincere. She wasn’t sure if she had done a “good job” preparing the welcome for the foreigner. That afternoon, she had searched the history books in the great library for information on how the last welcoming event had been carried out, but all she found were a few references about the decorations and attire that should be used. It all seemed too “festive” for the occasion, so she decided to set it aside. She asked one of the members of the brotherhood assigned to the “Grand Procession” to assist with the formations while she handled the invitations and decorations. The final result seemed to be the most fitting for the moment.

On another front, the painter she had commissioned was already preparing paintings for the nation’s historical memory, so that in the future, those responsible for future welcomes would have a more tangible reference.

“The future,” Dana thought, pausing on that word. Once again, a sense of darkness and silence enveloped her.

“Silence... Too much silence!” Dana exclaimed, alerted by a sense of danger. The soldiers, knights, and acolytes of the temple also felt the shift in the atmosphere.

Dana turned and directed her gaze toward the temple. The light that always emanated from it had vanished. The air itself felt tense, as though it were about to explode. The moment had come.

“Hold your positions. Follow the orders you’ve been given. You are all the pride of Cunabula—prove it tonight!” Dana roared, her call answered by the excitement of all those present.

In response to her words, there was an explosion of light from the temple. It burst into multicolored flames, and a rainbow beam shot up into the sky. Soon, the entire firmament began to flicker, revealing the invisible dome that covered the island.

The temple doors began to open, and Dana bowed in respect. Seven trumpets began to sound in succession as the banners of the Knights Brotherhood and the ‘Temple Brotherhood’ rose majestically.

Finally, the temple doors fully opened, revealing two figures advancing toward Dana. One was the Grand Patriarch, known for his authority and wisdom. The other figure, shrouded in mystery and hidden beneath a black cloak, was the Midnight Emissary.

“Rise, daughter of Cunabula,” echoed the magnanimous voice of the Grand Patriarch.

Dana obeyed, finding herself face-to-face with her mentor, and beside him, the enigmatic visitor.

“Midnight Emissary”—this was the title given to the foreigner visiting Cunabula, but Dana knew his true identity and knew that he had made “unofficial” visits in the past. Just as in those previous visits, he hid his figure beneath a complete black cloak. The only difference she noted this time was the three-star brooch adorning his attire.

Following the established protocol, Dana spoke solemnly: “Grand Patriarch, Midnight Emissary, on behalf of the blessed kingdom of Cunabula, I offer you a warm welcome. As Primado of the Temple of Harmony Order, I will be your guide on this occasion.”

“Thank you, Primado Dana,” the Grand Patriarch replied gratefully.

“Thank you, Dana,” added the Emissary’s musical voice with a hint of seriousness. “However, I will not require it at this moment. I will remain in the temple until I am called to deliver my message to the Cunabula council. The Grand Patriarch will inform you of further details,” he concluded abruptly, and without another word, retreated quickly into the temple.

Dana felt surprised and irritated by the Emissary’s arrogant demeanor. Furthermore, the temple was the most sacred place in the kingdom, and for a foreigner to treat it as if it were his own was offensive. However, it was ‘her,’ and she had no choice but to accept it.

“What does all this mean, Grand Patriarch?” Dana asked her mentor seriously.

“Dana, I need to meet with the king and the council at this moment. Come with me; I will explain the situation on the way,” the Grand Patriarch replied, with a tone of weariness and affliction he rarely displayed. Dana understood that she should ask no more questions and began to walk alongside her mentor down the path that led to the city.
