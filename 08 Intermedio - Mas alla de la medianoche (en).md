Tartarus, shortly after midnight...

Badwhiz Starheart raced hurriedly through the crumbling hallways that led to one of the outer watchtowers of the massive prison. He had received an urgent order from Balor to gather all the Knights of Order in the war room. Fully aware of the weight of the task he carried, he hadn't stopped even for a moment to catch his breath, completely determined to fulfill the mission as quickly as possible.

So far, locating Morrigan, Ceridwen, and Mannah had been relatively simple. However, finding Taranis was proving to be a frustrating challenge. The latter, after having a duel with Danu hours earlier, was neither in the medical bay where Badwhiz had last seen him nor in his quarters where he usually rested.

With no further leads, Badwhiz had sought guidance from Balor herself, who only informed him that Taranis was near one of the outer towers.

Armed with nothing but this vague direction, Badwhiz had hurriedly traveled the long path to reach the designated location.

Finally, after ascending a spiraling staircase, the young pony found the door to the tower's exterior wide open. Without hesitation, he crossed the threshold in haste.

Outside, bathed in the pale light of the moon, stretched a desolate lookout platform, barren and without railings.

Though he had anticipated the stark emptiness as he climbed, the unease that gripped him upon arriving took him by surprise. There was no trace of his objective.

"Did he slip away without permission again? Right now, of all times! Oh, hooves! How am I supposed to explain this to Lord Balor?" Badwhiz muttered anxiously, glancing down at the valley from the edge of the platform.

The volcanic landscape of Tartarus sprawled out as far as the eye could see. Rows of fumaroles and geysers marred the land, weaving through acidic lakes and deep geological fissures. Amid this desolate expanse, a winding path—barely deserving of the term—could be faintly seen in the distance. If anyone dared to escape this place, that path would be their only relatively safe route.

Of course, that only applied to those confined to walking. For those who commanded the skies, the situation was entirely different...

From the lookout, Badwhiz raised his gaze, scanning the valley clouds for any sign of his mentor. Lord Taranis—or simply Taranis, as he preferred to be called—was a master of the skies. It was highly unlikely anyone would find him treading on such a terrestrial path. Thus, Badwhiz focused his attention on the heavens, where it seemed more logical to locate him.

However, the deceptive height of the lookout was beginning to take its toll on him. Gradually, his gaze shifted to the jagged spikes jutting from the abyss beneath the tower. These gleamed under the moonlight, shining like menacing teeth.

The young pony swallowed hard, feeling the creeping fear of the void grow within him. From this height, a fall would be fatal. Although his armor included mechanical wings he could use to prevent such a fate, he lacked the natural instincts of a pegasus and had little confidence in his flying skills—still new and, in his opinion, clumsy. A chill ran up his spine and settled in his temple, intensifying his unease.

"Maybe I should call out from farther back... Lord Taranis will surely hear me if I do that," Badwhiz murmured, trying to convince himself that this was the most sensible solution. Trembling, he took a few steps back, putting distance between himself and the treacherous edge.

Then, without warning, like the swipe of a giant's hand, a sudden gust of wind pushed him from behind.

Before he could react, the ground beneath his hooves vanished, and for a fleeting moment, he found himself suspended in mid-air before plummeting into the abyss.

"Ahhh! AAAAAAAHHHHHHH!"

Badwhiz's delayed scream tore through the air as he flailed his wings desperately, trying to gain lift and return to the lookout. But his movements were awkward, and the jagged ground below, with its lethal spikes awaiting him, drew closer with horrifying speed.

However, just as impact seemed inevitable, a new wind emerged from nowhere, wrapping around him with force and lifting him back toward the tower. As though bouncing off an invisible cushion of air, he ascended rapidly, retracing the entire height he had fallen.

To his astonishment, he landed precisely where he had been standing moments earlier, staring out at the valley.

"What...? How...?" Badwhiz stammered, his heart pounding furiously, unable to comprehend what had just occurred.

"Kid, you need more practice with your flying. Gliding is fine, but you can do so much more with those wings."

The voice that echoed behind him was unmistakable. Badwhiz turned immediately, coming face-to-face with an imposing figure: a creature that appeared to be a fusion of bull and serpent. He was unclothed, but this did nothing to diminish his authority or presence. In fact, the moonlight, combined with the tattered bandages adorning parts of his body, only heightened the intimidating shadow of the warrior.

Standing before Badwhiz was Lord Taranis, Knight of Order and bearer of the Element of Pride.

Although relieved to have found the one he had been searching for, Badwhiz was too stunned to express his joy. He was still breathless and speechless from his unexpected landing.

"Don't give me that look, kid. The effort is worth it. Imagine the wind as your partner in a dance. Let it guide you at first, then pull it toward you... make it move to your rhythm," Taranis said, his limbs and long tail moving with an almost hypnotic grace. His casual tone contrasted with the young pony's seriousness, but it hinted at the good-natured humor he often displayed.

"Haaa... Lord Taranis... Lord Balor requests your presence... in the war room immediately..." Badwhiz finally managed to say, still gasping for air.

Walking through one of the secret passages within Tartarus...

Badwhiz, accompanied by the newly located Taranis, made his way toward the war room.

Taranis, now clad in his imposing warrior armor, flexed his muscular arms as he walked with apparent ease. Though he felt some tension in his elbows, he paid it no mind. Training with Danu had been as fruitless as ever. He hadn't wanted to spar this time, but Mannah had insisted so vehemently that he finally relented. Despite Mannah’s repeated pleas to treat the duel as a real fight, Taranis couldn’t take it seriously. To him, training was nothing like battling on the field, much like reading a recipe was not the same as preparing the dish in the kitchen.

This last thought sparked an idea in his mind.

"Hey, kid! Feeling tired? What do you say we stop by the kitchen before seeing Balor? I think Morrigan still has some soul-vanilla fritters in the pantry..."

“Ah! N-no, no! Thank you for the offer, Lord Taranis, but I don’t think this is the right moment for something like that. Lord Balor is expecting us to join the others as soon as possible,” Badwhiz replied quickly, his tone blending respect with the evident fatigue of the late hour.

"Ha! So serious! I like that, but you should loosen up a bit more. Well, what if we stop by the showers first?"

“Please, no more offers, Lord Taranis. Remember that as a knight, you have an obligation to carry out orders.”

Taranis stopped abruptly, his expression shifting to a stern, almost menacing glare.

“Are you saying I don’t fulfill my duties?”

Badwhiz paled, stumbling back a step as his voice turned nervous.

“No! No, I didn’t mean that! I apologize, Lord Taranis! I didn’t mean to offend!”

As the young pony bowed deeply in search of forgiveness, Taranis let out a hearty laugh. The severity in his face disappeared as quickly as it had come.

"Ha! Relax, kid. I’m just messing with you. You’re funny, you know that?"

Badwhiz looked up, still confused, but he began to sense the playful tone of his companion.

“You really remind me of Danu, kid,” Taranis added with a broad grin.

"I don’t think I’m anything like the great feudal lord, Lord Taranis," Badwhiz responded shyly, suspecting his master was teasing him again.

“Ah, not as he is now. But he wasn’t always the great feudal lord of Cunabula, all serious and rigid... I knew him when he was your age. Believe me, he wasn’t so different from you back then. Those were good times...” Taranis said, sighing as he gazed up at the ceiling.

Badwhiz watched him curiously. Taranis’s words filled him with intrigue. It was hard to imagine someone as imposing as Danu (the leader of the Knights of Order) being young... and similar to him?

Lost in thought, Badwhiz barely noticed the shift in the atmosphere until a booming voice abruptly yanked him from his reverie.

“Hey! Stop daydreaming! Let’s get to the war room already,” Taranis barked at the colt. With a flick of his tail, he summoned a gust of wind that enveloped him, propelling him at high speed down the corridor, leaving a bewildered Badwhiz behind.

Panicked at the thought of being accused of tardiness if he didn’t keep up, Badwhiz hastily unfurled his wings and took off after Taranis. Navigating the hallway, rounding corners clumsily, and narrowly dodging columns (he came perilously close to slamming into the walls at least three times), he finally reached Taranis, panting and heart pounding, in front of the imposing doors of the war room.

Taranis waited with arms crossed, his stance radiating arrogance.

“I won. Do you think I should inform the others about this ‘performance’?” he asked, a teasing smile on his lips.

“Please, don’t,” Badwhiz replied, breathless and slightly pale.

“Ha! Ha! Ha!” Taranis laughed, visibly amused. However, his laughter stopped short as the war room doors creaked open. In the doorway stood a tall, menacing figure, silhouetted like a dragon.

Balor, with his usual cold gaze, exuded an intense presence that seemed to fill the air. The atmosphere grew heavy in an instant. Always vigilant, Taranis adjusted his posture, standing at attention.

“You’re late, Taranis. But I’m relieved you’re here at last,” Balor said in a low, deliberate tone.

“My apologies, Balor. I needed to clear my head after training with His Excellency,” Taranis replied, bowing his head slightly.

“It’s fine. Come in,” Balor said, pushing the doors open and gesturing for Taranis to enter.

Inside, the war room was shrouded in shadows, illuminated only by a cluster of ornate candles on the meeting table and dim lights hanging from the ceiling. Despite the darkness, Taranis’s trained eyes could make out the silhouettes of several comrades already seated. However, something about the atmosphere felt off.

With a serious expression, Taranis shot an inquisitive look at Balor, as if trying to discern the source of the underlying tension. Balor, however, remained impassive and turned his attention to Badwhiz.

“Kid,” Balor said in a firm but neutral tone, “go to the pantry and bring us drinks, along with some snacks. And take a shower before you return. You have 30 minutes, no more.”

“Yes, right away!” Badwhiz responded firmly, snapping to attention instinctively. However, before leaving, he cast a furtive glance at his master. The tension on Taranis’s face, as he entered the war room with a deliberately brisk pace, did not escape him.

With a restless heart, Badwhiz turned and hurried away, leaving behind his master and Balor, engulfed in a shadowy room charged with uncertainty.

[---]

The exact amount of time had passed. Badwhiz had showered, prepared the drinks, and arranged the snacks on a silver tray. Now, with the tray balanced on his back, he found himself once again before the doors of the war room.

Before he could knock, the doors opened on their own, as if inviting him inside. The interior was still shrouded in shadows, so Badwhiz activated the light on his armor's horn, casting a gentle glow to guide his cautious steps.

As he crossed the threshold, the tension in the room hit him like an icy gust. Around a circular table, six seats were occupied by the Knights of Order, all except for Danu and Taranis. Before them, a circular mirror projected images that dimly illuminated the space. Despite the curiosity this sight stirred in Badwhiz, he refrained from asking questions and began discreetly distributing the drinks.

The knights remained silent, not taking the drinks directly. Badwhiz simply placed the cups on the table. Something about the unnerving stillness of the room unsettled him; he had never experienced such a charged atmosphere during a meeting.

All present had their eyes fixed on the images reflected in the mirror.

Once he finished distributing the drinks and set the tray of snacks aside, Badwhiz positioned himself next to Balor’s chair, awaiting further instructions.

“Do you truly believe your brother will ascend to power?” Morrigan broke the silence, her voice sharp and laced with subtle mockery as she cast a piercing glance at Mannah.

“He is the most suitable candidate given the current crisis. Neither the council nor the temple will oppose him,” Mannah replied without taking his eyes off the mirror.

“I wouldn’t be so sure,” Morrigan countered, tilting her head. “The king still has many supporters, and the ‘Grand Primate’ has the backing of the Great Patriarch. If that’s the case, then the ‘Grand Primate’ would be...”

Morrigan’s words were abruptly cut off. Balor interrupted her calmly after taking a sip of his drink.

“The worst option right now,” he concluded in a dry tone. Without looking away from Mannah, he added, “But that’s jumping ahead. Morrigan, wait until this is over before drawing conclusions.”

Morrigan shot a defiant look at Balor, but he remained impassive, ignoring her.

“Pay attention. It’s about to begin,” Ceridwen commanded, bringing the room to silence.

The images in the mirror began to move, and Badwhiz, who had never seen such a device before, started to realize they were projections of a distant place, though he couldn’t identify where.

The mirror emitted a faint hum, as if trying to tune in: “Bzzz... Council of Cunabula... members of the temple... bzzz.” Finally, the images stabilized, revealing a vast amphitheater. Its white and gold seats encircled an imposing silver podium. The atmosphere was charged with anticipation, and all the creatures present—resembling the Knights of Order—watched in silence, awaiting the next speaker.

Badwhiz, caught up in the tension, sharpened his senses.

After a round of applause and a moment of hushed silence, a figure cloaked in black emerged from the shadows and swiftly approached the center of the podium. There, it stopped and scanned the audience with a penetrating gaze.

When the glowing eyes from within the dark hood met Badwhiz’s through the mirror, a shiver ran down the young pony’s spine almost immediately. Instinctively, he looked away, gripped by an inexplicable fear. How could that being have seen him? He tried to calm himself, reasoning that it was merely looking toward the other side of the mirror, but the unease lingered.

Cautiously, Badwhiz glanced back. To his horror, the figure was still staring at him.

For a moment, through the blurry haze of the projection, he thought he saw the figure crack a smile.

Then, as if the mirror itself came to life, limb-like arms emerged from the black cloak. The entity pulled back its hood, revealing its true form.

Badwhiz held his breath. The creature was monstrous, and the air in the war room grew even heavier. Even the Knights of Order, accustomed to all manner of horrors, seemed taken aback.

Balor gripped the edge of the table with his claws, his gaze locked on the figure.

“GREETINGS, INHABITANTS OF CUNABULA!” the entity proclaimed in a thunderous voice. “FEAR NOT, I COME TO YOU WITH A MESSAGE OF PEACE.”

Though its words might have sounded conciliatory, from the mouth of such a creature, they felt as empty as ashes on the wind.

In a corner of the room, Taranis observed in silence. Still reeling from the news that the King had abdicated that very night, his eyes lingered on the noble banner of Cunabula hanging on the wall. As the tension among his companions rose, he turned to the mirror.

Upon recognizing the figure projected within, a look of pure hatred crossed his face.

“Damned Midnight Emissary,” he muttered bitterly.

Though his words were barely a whisper, they resonated in the tension-filled room. No one dared contradict him, for all shared the same sentiment: a simmering hatred for the being that had desecrated the order they held so dear.
