In the majestic castle of Canterlot, Princess Twilight Sparkle, the ruler of Equestria, entered with a regal stride into one of the most exclusive rooms of her kingdom. This chamber, reserved only for her and a select group of ponies, was always ready to welcome her distinguished guests. As she walked in, the princess was greeted by a delicate scent of lavender that filled the air, mingling with the gentle evening breeze that filtered through the beautiful stained glass windows adorning the tall walls. The warmth of the room, familiar and inviting, was maintained by a crackling fireplace at the far end.

Twilight moved forward leisurely, shedding her royal demeanor with each step. With every stride, she cast off the adornments of her princess title. Her gown magically slid to one side, the clasps that held it fell softly onto the carpet, and the hoof protectors rolled off effortlessly, bumping against some piece of furniture or the wall of the room. She only took special care when placing her crown on a special bust next to a large personal wardrobe.

Finally, with no accessories to distinguish her—just being herself—Twilight leaped onto the plush sofa in one corner of the room. Her descent was slow, defying gravity, thanks to the magic of her alicorn wings. Like a feather falling softly, Twilight settled onto her sofa.

The contact of her body with the furniture was perfectly silent, a testament to the habit she had developed after countless days of hard work. In a comfortable position, she remained still for long minutes until, slowly, she stretched her body, pressing against the couch, seeking to feel all the coolness of the inert furniture against her coat.

Twilight was exhausted.

The Festival of the Two Sisters was scheduled for the next day, and she had been busy handling requests all day long. Not just today, but throughout the entire week, she had felt overwhelmed by her royal duties. She had to deal with the end of the fiscal year for Equestria, attend the awards ceremony at the School of Friendship, participate in the graduation ceremony at the School of Magic, and attend to many other matters that required her personal attention. In short, it had been a grueling week.

She was an alicorn, and more importantly, a pony who knew how to stay organized. She had the time and experience to manage her daily responsibilities. However, there were days like this when she felt as if she had aged centuries since her coronation. She was aware that it was an exaggeration since only three years had passed. Still, when she found herself alone and reflecting on the time that had passed, filled with intense work and responsibilities, she couldn't help but feel a fleeting, childish sense of frustration.

Twilight lifted a hoof into the air and gave the sofa a hard smack, repeating it four more times. After this, following a moment of stillness, she stood up and briefly examined it to check for any damage. Upon confirming that it was in perfect condition, she fell heavily onto it.

The fluffy sofa had withstood the impact of her hooves like no other sofa in Equestria could have. She had acquired it on the recommendation of a good friend. At first, Twilight thought the price of the furniture was outrageous, but so far it had been worth every bit she had paid for it.

This was the famous super-fluffy and soft sofa recommended by Rarity, who claimed it was "fit for the 'royal' rest of a princess," and it had the special approval of Rainbow Dash. Of course, the "special approval" meant that Rainbow Dash had used it first, which didn’t go very well, given her friend's refusal to leave it due to how comfortable it was. The incident in the store had been so embarrassing that they had to use magic to get her out of there.

Reclining on her sofa, Twilight let out a small smile as she reminisced about those times and scanned the rest of the room. There were other familiar and cherished items, like Pinkie Pie's mini candy machine, whose sweets always provided the perfect flavor to recharge her on the heaviest days.

There was also Fluttershy's library of relaxation books. Whenever she had trouble falling asleep, she would pick a book at random and dive into it. To date, she had never managed to finish one; just reading a page or two was enough to send her to sleep right there.

Finally, there was Applejack's coat rack, which, interestingly, was the item she had used the most. Not to hang gowns or royal attire, but rather as a genuine "idea tree" or "idea rack," where she hung all her plans and thoughts written on cards whenever she needed to work through a complex problem.

All these items were gifts from her friends and brought back fond memories of shared moments in the past. Tomorrow they would gather again, and that excited her a lot, but Twilight also knew there was still work to be done. And despite her tiredness, she had enough duty and energy to finish it.

Someone knocked gently on the door.

"Twilight, are you in there? I have the documents you asked for," Spike called from the other side.

"Yes, Spike, just a moment." Twilight straightened her posture to appear more dignified, using her magic to tidy up her royal attire, which was scattered around the room. Finally, she opened the door, and a stack of scrolls came in, with Spike dutifully trapped underneath.

"Here are all the scrolls. Wow, they’re lighter than last year!" exclaimed the young purple dragon sarcastically as he dropped the load onto the central table in the room.

"Yeah, this year we’ve resolved a lot of issues. But look on the bright side: next year you'll have less weight to carry," Twilight replied as she used her magic to pick up some scrolls that had fallen to the floor.

"I’m just worried it’s more than we can handle," Spike said, frowning with concern.

Twilight didn’t respond and began sorting the scrolls by the color of their labels. Each one, in a different size, was a summary of some issue, problem, or event that had been marked as "monitored" throughout the year.

The scrolls also varied in four colors that represented the reason for labeling: green for opportunities, blue for strengths, orange for weaknesses, and red for threats.

This basic management exercise was necessary as it would serve as a prelude to the annual analysis she would conduct after the festivities.

Twilight used her magic to pull the "idea rack" closer and took out a clean set of notecards. She was ready, mentally preparing to start with the green scrolls and finish with the red ones.

"Spike, can you bring me some pudding and chocolate? We’ll need a bit of fuel for this little marathon!" Twilight asked, smiling.

[---]

A couple of hours had passed, and Twilight had finally finished reviewing the penultimate scroll of the many that had been pending. Taking a breather from her work, with almost all her notecards used up, she looked around and noticed an empty plate with crumbs of pudding on the table. Spike had been a great help at first, offering suggestions and organizing the notes on the "idea rack." Now, however, he was comfortably sprawled on a sofa, sipping hot chocolate while reading a hefty book with a fancy golden cover.

Twilight's curiosity was piqued as she glanced at the eye-catching book her relaxed assistant was engrossed in.

"What are you reading, Spike?" she asked with interest.

"Mmm, it's the latest book by A.K. Yearling, Daring Do and the Unfinished Journeys."

Twilight bit her lip immediately. After a long wait, the author A.K. Yearling had released a new Daring Do book earlier that week.

Seeing Twilight's look of dismay, Spike struck a proud pose. "It holds the record for being the bestselling book in its first week and is also the longest one she's written. It's an anthology of short stories from different genres that recount her travels across Equestria and beyond. It includes autobiographical stories and material..."

"Please, don’t go on, Spike," Twilight interrupted with a sigh. Even though she had her own copy, she hadn't had time to read it due to the work of the past few days. She could already imagine her friend Rainbow Dash, an avid Daring Do fan, bragging about everything she knew about the book during tomorrow’s gathering. Something that would be less awkward if she could just take a quick glance at the summary...

"Not!" Twilight scolded herself internally. She knew she had to finish her work, and there was only one scroll left to review.

Determined, she picked up the last remaining red scroll and read the label. She immediately recalled what it was about.

"Thanks, but let’s save the 'spoilers' for later, okay?" Twilight said with a serious expression as she opened the last scroll and began to review it. Spike watched her with concern as he finished his cup of hot chocolate. He also knew what this scroll was about.

This was a delicate matter that Twilight couldn’t keep ignoring.

[---]

The "Knights of the Order"...

It all began three years ago. Shortly after her coronation, Twilight started to define the path Equestria would take under her rule. Among her first objectives was to improve relations with neighboring realms and beyond. She sent her friends and acquaintances as ambassadors, carrying a message of friendship and respect, hoping to learn more about the realities of those territories and, if possible, establish ties of mutual collaboration.

These expeditions successfully reached their destinations, transmitting Twilight's message of friendship. However, during these travels, an unexpected discovery occurred: the existence of other Trees of Harmony outside of Equestria. These trees, with meanings and magic distinct from what they knew in the land of ponies, presented complex challenges for the expedition teams. With the improvised support of the ambassadors and the help of new allies in these realms, they managed to activate the magic of each of these Trees and uncover their bearers.

It was then that the problems began. Twilight’s friends soon discovered that they had not been the first to find these Trees.

Many moons ago, a mysterious group had come from faraway lands to these realms, awakening the magic of the Trees of Harmony with the intent of protecting those territories and bringing prosperity to their inhabitants. They erected temples at the sites of the Trees and placed mechanisms that allowed the inhabitants of each realm to properly access their magic.

They called themselves the Knights of Harmony and hailed from the magical kingdom of Cunabula. Their mission was to awaken the magic of harmony in the world. In a crusade for balance, they discovered five of the six existing Trees and were on the verge of awakening the sixth and final one in Equestria.

However, their purpose was unfulfilled. Upon arriving in the land of ponies, they encountered Discord, the Lord of Chaos. At that time, Discord, mischievous and unpredictable, decided that if he couldn’t take the Knights of Harmony as his playthings, he would use his chaotic magic to manipulate the inhabitants of the other realms the Knights had previously visited, provoking a war against them.

The conflict was devastating for Cunabula. Betrayed by the very realms they had helped, the Knights of Harmony sealed the temples they had built and erased any trace of harmony magic from them. They decided to hide their kingdom from the eyes of the world and eliminate all evidence of their existence.

Renouncing the title of the Knights of Harmony, they rebranded themselves as the Knights of the Order, swearing to protect their kingdom and maintain order in the world. They were determined to eliminate anyone who tried to awaken the magic of the Trees once more.

This crusade lay dormant for over a millennium, until Twilight and her friends unknowingly reignited it.

Without offering explanations, the Knights of the Order took action against the realms where the magic of the Trees of Harmony had been awakened. This led Danu, the leader of the current Knights, to confront Twilight and her friends directly in Canterlot. After an intense confrontation, Twilight and her friends found themselves cornered, at the mercy of the Knights, who planned to eradicate the harmony magic still residing within them.

Fortunately, with the help of other friends present at that moment and the timely arrival of new allies from the other realms, they managed to thwart the Knights' plans and save the city from disaster.

Defeated, and with the consent of the leaders of the other realms, the Knights of the Order were imprisoned and taken to Tartarus, Equestria’s magical prison, where they would remain locked away until the present...

[---]

Twilight sighed as she finished reading the contents of the red scroll. The report was exactly what she expected: the situation of the Knights of the Order in Tartarus remained unchanged, and the results of the investigations into Cunabula were the same as the previous year.

In other words, there had been no progress.

Since their imprisonment, the Knights of the Order had remained in Tartarus without attempting to escape or cooperate to improve their situation. Despite Twilight's efforts to establish a connection with Danu, the leader of the Knights, he had maintained a stiff posture, refusing to speak with her during her visits. His companions acted the same way. Thus, apart from what they discovered in their first encounter, they had learned nothing more about them.

On the other hand, the island of Cunabula continued to be an impenetrable mystery. It didn’t appear in any history books of Equestria or in the archives of the allied realms. In a letter from Ornithia, Star Swirl the Bearded claimed to have discovered the flag of that nation: a green banner with a silver tree surrounded by six stars. After exhaustive research, he concluded that the kingdom was probably somewhere in the southern seas. Unfortunately, that was all the information he could find. Still, Twilight had decided to extend the investigation year after year, up until today.

Twilight flopped back on the couch. The fact that the situation remained the same could be seen as a success for a disengaged leader content with makeshift solutions. But she wasn’t that kind of leader. The more she thought about the Knights of the Order, the more her unease grew...

"Tell me, Spike, why do you think no representative from Cunabula has tried to contact us after the defeat of the Knights of the Order?" Twilight asked, not taking her eyes off the ceiling.

"Uhmm…" Spike pondered, adopting a thoughtful posture, though he was actually ready for the question. "Maybe they’re not very popular back home, and by locking them up, we did their people a favor."

"Do you really think so?" Twilight replied without turning toward her assistant. "I remember my first meeting with Danu and his companions. They didn’t seem like reckless tyrants, but rather individuals who were conservative, too committed to their cause…"

Twilight closed her eyes, reflecting. Maybe she was giving them too much credit, but many of Danu’s words made her think that she had only seen one facet of her opponent. The fact that he had initiated the conversation during their first meeting reinforced that idea.

"Well… maybe Cunabula is a bit lost now that they’re gone," Spike continued, not measuring his words too carefully, "or maybe they’re afraid to leave their island… I mean, home."

"It’s been three years, Spike. By now, Cunabula should have new leaders," Twilight responded, opening her eyes. "Even if that weren’t the case, their followers would have tried to find or rescue them. Besides, think about how quickly they managed to reach Equestria and the power they demonstrated in battle. I don’t think fear of getting lost or hurt is holding them back."

Twilight thought about the plot from Ornithia, the Knights of the Order’s actions in Canterlot, and their discoveries about the temples of harmony. Cunabula was not something to be taken lightly. It was a kingdom that had been using harmony magic over a thousand years ago. Clearly, they had been far ahead of their time back then. She couldn’t imagine how much things had changed since then. Being isolated from the world for so long might have hindered their progress in certain aspects, but it could also have propelled their development in other unexpected directions.

"I think that’s all my theories…" Spike murmured, exhausted, settling into his seat. Twilight didn’t blame him; she had too much on her mind at that moment as well.

Twilight had to admit it: she knew very little about Cunabula. Its government, its history, its customs… the ignorance was overwhelming. There could well be other hidden actors who, from the shadows, were guiding decisions in that kingdom and watching the events in Equestria coldly. This hypothesis would explain the behavior of the Knights of the Order, who perhaps were simply waiting for the right moment to act.

If that were the case, what happened during the attack on Canterlot could repeat itself... or result in something even worse.

As she pondered, Twilight felt a bitter taste spread in her mouth, as if something was right in front of her, but she couldn't see it fully.

Could she really make a responsible decision with so much unknown? Should she file the case away and leave the Knights of the Order in Tartarus indefinitely? Would it make sense to prepare more escape plans in case of another attack?

The most irresponsible thing would be to just let them go, although...

"What if we just let them go?" Spike suggested jokingly, trying to lighten the tension.

Twilight looked at him, clearly annoyed. "Do you really think that?"

Spike raised his claws, nervous. "Well... I’m just saying that if all this is too much for us, maybe letting them go wouldn’t make a big difference…"

"Did Discord suggest that to you?" Twilight asked with a serious expression.

"Yeah," Spike admitted, sinking a little in his seat. He had consulted the "Lord of Chaos" about the matter, considering he was partly responsible for the situation. Naturally, Discord’s answer had been typically chaotic.

Twilight sighed once more. "I think, in a way, he’s right. But it’s not a decision I can make alone. I need the other realms to consider my point of view. However, I don’t have solid arguments to back up that action… just a faint hope," she said, looking disheartened at the scroll.

Asking Discord for help in judging the case could backfire due to his past mischief. Besides, she doubted the Knights of the Order would accept any "sincere" apologies from the "Lord of Chaos."

If she simply released them, the other realms would surely see Equestria as an unreliable ally. And allowing those criminals, who had sworn to destroy them and had already attacked two realms, to return to their country to continue their conspiracies would put Equestria at risk. Though Twilight wanted to believe that the Knights of the Order wouldn’t intervene again, she knew that the most likely outcome was the opposite.

In the end, she still couldn’t decide. She would have to wait and reflect more before reaching a conclusion.

With her magic, Twilight carefully stored the scroll in a special box along with other documents that would also be addressed next year. Seeing the accumulated amount compared to the previous year, she realized how much her workload continued to grow. With a resigned sigh, she began to sort through the rest of the papers.

When she finished, she felt a slight relief. The clock indicated there were still three hours until midnight.

"It’s still early! How about we do a surprise inspection to check out this year’s decorations?" Twilight suggested to Spike as she stood up.

"I don’t know, Twilight. I’m feeling a bit tired today," Spike replied, pretending to yawn while trying to hide a thick book behind him. "Why don’t you go alone this time?"

"Really? I thought taking my ‘number one assistant’ on my ‘royal back’ would be a great reward for his hard work," Twilight joked with a sly smile as she donned her royal attire. She already had an idea of Spike’s true source of "tiredness."

Spike couldn’t resist the temptation and, flapping his little wings, jumped onto Twilight’s back.

"Now that I think about it, I think I have an important message for the head chef. Do you mind if we swing by the kitchen first, Twilight?"

"Sure, but on the way, you have to tell me some stories from the new Daring Do book," she replied, levitating her crown and gently placing it on her head.

"Perfect! Have you ever heard of the 'Hill of Eternity'?" Spike asked excitedly.

Both of them left the room smiling, leaving behind an untouched pudding and a cup of chocolate.
