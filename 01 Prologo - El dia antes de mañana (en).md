In the majestic castle of Canterlot, Princess Twilight Sparkle, ruler of Equestria, entered one of the kingdom’s most exclusive chambers with a regal step befitting royalty. This room, reserved solely for her and a select group of ponies, was always prepared to welcome her distinguished guests. As she stepped inside, Twilight was greeted by a delicate lavender fragrance that permeated the air, blending with the soft evening breeze filtering through the beautiful glass windows adorning the tall walls. The room’s warmth, familiar and welcoming, was maintained by a lit fireplace at the far end.

Twilight moved forward unhurriedly, setting aside her noble demeanor with each step. She gradually removed the adornments that came with her royal title. Her dress magically slipped to the side, the clasps that held it in place fell softly onto the carpet, and the protectors on her hooves rolled effortlessly, clinking against some furniture or wall of the room. She took particular care when placing her crown on a special bust situated next to a large personal wardrobe.

Finally, with nothing left to mark her as royalty, Twilight leapt onto the plush couch tucked away in a corner of the room. Her descent was slow, defying gravity, thanks to the magic in her alicorn wings. Like a feather drifting gently down, Twilight found herself on the couch.

Her body made no sound as it met the cushions, proof of the habit she’d developed after countless days of hard work. Settling into a comfortable position, she lay still for several minutes until, slowly, she stretched out, pressing herself into the cushions, wanting to feel every bit of the couch’s coolness against her coat.

Twilight was exhausted.

The Festival of the Two Sisters was scheduled for the next day, and she’d spent the entire day dealing with requests. Not just today, but the entire week had been an overwhelming blur of royal duties. She had taken care of Equestria’s fiscal year-end closing, attended an award ceremony at the School of Friendship, participated in the graduation ceremony at the School of Magic, and handled numerous other matters that demanded her personal attention. In short, it had been a tiring week.

She was an alicorn, and, more importantly, a pony who knew how to stay organized. She had the time and experience to manage her daily responsibilities. However, there were days like today when she felt like she’d aged centuries since her coronation. She knew it was an exaggeration, as only three years had passed. Even so, when she was alone and thought about the time that had flown by, filled with intense work and responsibilities, she couldn’t help but feel a fleeting, childish pang of frustration.

Twilight raised a hoof into the air and slammed it down hard on the couch, repeating the action four more times. After a brief pause of stillness, she stood up and examined the couch to make sure she hadn’t damaged it. Confirming that it was in perfect condition, she slumped back onto it heavily.

The plushy couch had withstood her hoof’s thumping like no other couch in Equestria could. She’d bought it on a good friend’s recommendation. At first, Twilight thought the price was outrageous, but so far, it had been worth every bit she’d spent.

This was the famous super plush, soft couch recommended by Rarity, who claimed it was "fit for the real rest of a princess" and had Rainbow Dash’s special approval. Of course, that “special approval” meant that Rainbow Dash had tried it first, which didn’t go over well, as she’d refused to get up from it due to how comfortable it was. The incident was so embarrassing they’d had to use magic to pull her out of the store.

Reclining on her couch, Twilight allowed herself a small smile while recalling those times, and let her gaze wander around the room. There were other familiar, cherished items here, like Pinkie Pie’s mini candy dispenser, which dispensed sweets that always provided her the perfect pick-me-up during long days.

Then there was Fluttershy’s collection of relaxation books. Whenever she had trouble sleeping, she’d grab a random one and start reading. To this day, she hadn’t finished a single one; usually, one or two pages were enough to lull her to sleep right then and there.

Lastly, there was Applejack’s stand-alone coat rack, which, oddly enough, was the item she’d used the most. Not for hanging dresses or royal attire, but rather as a true “idea tree” or “idea rack,” where she hung up all her plans and written thoughts on cards when she needed to solve a complex problem.

All of these items were gifts from her friends, bringing back fond memories of times spent together. They’d be gathering again tomorrow, which made her feel excited, yet Twilight knew she still had work to do. And despite her exhaustion, she had just enough energy to finish it.

Someone knocked lightly on the door.

“Twilight, are you in there? I’ve got the documents you asked for,” Spike called from the other side.

“Yes, Spike, give me a moment.” Twilight straightened her posture to look more dignified, using her magic to gather her royal attire, which was scattered around the room. Finally, she opened the door, and a stack of scrolls entered, with Spike dutifully buried underneath.

“Alright, here are all the scrolls. Whoa, they’re so much lighter than last year!” the young purple dragon said sarcastically, dropping the load onto the room’s central table.

“Yes, we’ve resolved a lot this year. But look on the bright side: next year, there’ll be even less for you to carry,” Twilight replied as she used her magic to pick up a few scrolls that had fallen to the floor.

“I’m just worried it’ll be more than we can handle,” Spike muttered, a frown creasing his forehead in concern.

Twilight didn’t respond, instead sorting the scrolls by the color of their tags. Each one, in varying sizes, was a summary of some issue, problem, or event that had been flagged as “observed” over the past year.

The scrolls also came in four shades, each representing the reason for its flag: green for opportunities, blue for strengths, orange for weaknesses, and red for threats.

This basic administrative exercise was necessary, as it served as a prelude to the annual analysis she’d conduct after the holidays.

Twilight summoned her “idea rack” with her magic and pulled out a fresh set of note cards. She was ready, mentally preparing herself to start with the green scrolls and work her way through to the reds.

“Spike, could you bring me some pudding and chocolate? We’ll need some fuel for this little marathon!” Twilight requested with a smile.

[---]

A couple of hours had passed, and Twilight had finally finished reviewing the second-to-last scroll among the many that had been piling up. Taking a break from her work, with almost all of her note cards used up, she looked around and noticed an empty plate with pudding crumbs on the table. Spike had been a great help at the start, offering suggestions and organizing the notes on the "idea rack." Now, however, he was resting comfortably on a sofa, sipping hot chocolate while reading a hefty book with an elegant gold frame.

Twilight’s curiosity was piqued when she saw the eye-catching book her relaxed assistant was reading.

“What are you reading, Spike?” she asked with interest.

“Uhmm, it’s the latest A.K. Yearling book, Daring Do and the Unfinished Journeys.”

Twilight immediately bit her lip. After a long wait, author A.K. Yearling had released a new Daring Do book earlier that week.

Seeing Twilight’s look of disappointment, Spike struck a smug pose. “It holds the record for best-selling book in its first week and is also the longest she’s ever written. It’s an anthology of short stories from different genres, chronicling her journeys across Equestria and the world. It includes autobiographical stories and even…”

“Please, no spoilers, Spike,” Twilight interrupted with a sigh. Though she had her own copy, she hadn’t had the time to read it due to all the work from the past few days. She could already picture her friend Rainbow Dash, a die-hard Daring Do fan, bragging about everything she knew about the book at tomorrow’s gathering. It would be a little less uncomfortable if she could just get a quick look at the summary…

“No!” Twilight scolded herself internally. She knew she had to finish her work, and only one scroll was left to review.

Determined, she took the last remaining red scroll and read its label. She instantly remembered what it was about.

“Thanks, but let’s save the ‘spoilers’ for later, alright?” Twilight said with a serious expression as she unrolled the final scroll and started reviewing it. Spike watched her, a bit worried, as he finished his cup of hot chocolate. He, too, knew what that scroll was about.

This was a delicate matter that Twilight could no longer keep putting off.

The "Knights of Order"...

It all began three years ago. Shortly after her coronation, Twilight started charting the course Equestria would take under her leadership. One of her first goals was to strengthen relations with neighboring kingdoms and even those beyond. She sent her friends and acquaintances as ambassadors, carrying a message of friendship and respect, hoping to learn more about the realities of these lands and, if possible, establish bonds of mutual collaboration.

These expeditions successfully reached their destinations, conveying Twilight’s message of friendship. However, during these journeys, an unexpected discovery was made: the existence of other Trees of Harmony outside Equestria. These trees, with meanings and magic different from the one known in the land of ponies, presented complex challenges for the expedition teams. With the improvised support of the ambassadors and the help of new allies in these kingdoms, they managed to activate the magic of each Tree and identify its bearers.

That was when the troubles began. Twilight’s friends soon discovered that they hadn’t been the first ones to find these Trees.

Many moons ago, a mysterious group had arrived from distant lands to these kingdoms, awakening the magic of the Trees of Harmony with the intent of protecting these territories and bringing prosperity to their inhabitants. They built temples in the places where the Trees were located and set up mechanisms that would allow the residents of each kingdom to properly access their magic.

They called themselves the Knights of Harmony, and they hailed from the magical kingdom of Cunabula. Their mission was to awaken the magic of harmony in the world. In a crusade for balance, they discovered five of the six existing Trees and were on the verge of awakening the sixth and final one in Equestria.

However, their purpose went unfulfilled. Upon reaching the land of ponies, they encountered Discord, the Lord of Chaos. At that time, Discord, malicious and unpredictable, decided that if he couldn’t take the Knights of Harmony as his playthings, he would use his chaotic magic to manipulate the inhabitants of the other kingdoms the Knights had previously visited, inciting a war against them.

The conflict was devastating for Cunabula. Betrayed by the very kingdoms they had helped, the Knights of Harmony closed off the temples they had built and erased any traces of harmony magic within them. They decided to hide their kingdom from the eyes of the world and erase all evidence of their existence.

Renouncing the title of Knights of Harmony, they renamed themselves the Knights of Order, swearing an oath to protect their kingdom and uphold order in the world. They were determined to eliminate anyone who tried to awaken the magic of the Trees again.

This crusade lay dormant for over a millennium, until Twilight and her friends unknowingly reawakened it.

Without offering any explanations, the Knights of Order took action against the kingdoms where the magic of the Trees of Harmony had been rekindled. This led Danu, the current leader of the Knights, to confront Twilight and her friends directly in Canterlot. After an intense battle, Twilight and her friends found themselves cornered, at the mercy of the Knights, who planned to eradicate the harmony magic that still dwelled within them.

Fortunately, with the help of other friends who were present at the time and the timely arrival of new allies from the other kingdoms, they managed to thwart the Knights’ plans and save the city from catastrophe.

Defeated, and with the consent of the leaders of the other kingdoms, the Knights of Order were imprisoned and taken to Tartarus, Equestria’s magical prison, where they have remained locked up to this day...

[---]

Twilight sighed as she finished reading the contents of the red scroll. The report was exactly what she expected: the situation of the Knights of Order in Tartarus remained unchanged, and the results of the investigations on Cunabula were the same as the previous year.

In other words, there had been no progress.

Since they were imprisoned, the Knights of Order had stayed in Tartarus without attempting to escape or cooperating to improve their situation. Despite Twilight’s efforts to establish a connection with Danu, the Knights' leader, he had maintained a rigid stance, refusing to speak with her during her visits. His companions acted in the same way. So, apart from what they learned during their first encounter, they hadn’t managed to learn anything more about them.

On the other hand, the island of Cunabula remained an impenetrable mystery. It didn’t appear in any history book in Equestria or in the archives of allied kingdoms. In a letter from Ornithia, Star Swirl the Bearded claimed to have discovered the nation’s flag: a green banner with a silver tree surrounded by six stars. After an exhaustive investigation, he concluded that the kingdom was probably located somewhere in the southern seas. Unfortunately, that was all the information he could find. Even so, Twilight had decided to extend the investigation year after year, right up to today.

Twilight let herself fall onto the sofa, staring up at the ceiling. For a leader with little commitment, satisfied with quick fixes, the situation remaining unchanged could be considered a success. But she wasn’t that kind of leader. The more she thought about the Knights of Order, the more her unease grew...

“Tell me, Spike, why do you think no representative from Cunabula has tried to contact us after the defeat of the Knights of Order?” Twilight asked, without taking her eyes off the ceiling.

“Uhmm…” Spike pondered, adopting a thoughtful pose, though he was actually prepared for the question. “Maybe they aren’t very popular at home, and by locking them up, we did their people a favor.”

"Do you really think so, Spike..." Twilight replied without turning toward her assistant. “I remember my first encounter with Danu and his companions well. They didn’t seem like reckless tyrants, but rather conservative individuals, overly committed to their cause…”

Twilight closed her eyes, reflecting. Maybe she was giving them too much credit, but many of Danu’s words made her think she had only seen one side of her opponent. The fact that he had initiated the conversation during their first encounter only reinforced that idea.

“Well… maybe they’re a bit lost over in Cunabula without them,” Spike continued, not measuring his words too carefully, “or maybe they’re afraid to leave their island… I mean, home.”

“It’s been three years, Spike. By now, Cunabula should already have new leaders,” Twilight replied, opening her eyes. “Even if that weren’t the case, their followers would have tried to seek them out or rescue them. Plus, consider how quickly they were able to reach Equestria and the power they demonstrated in battle. I don’t think fear of getting lost or hurt is what’s holding them back.”

Twilight thought about the plot in Ornithia, the actions of the Knights of Order in Canterlot, and what she had learned about the harmony temples. Cunabula was not something to take lightly. It was a kingdom that had been using harmony magic for over a thousand years. Clearly, they were well ahead of their time back then. She couldn’t imagine how much it might have changed since. Being isolated from the world for so long could have hindered their progress in certain ways, but it might also have pushed their development in other unexpected directions.

“I think that’s all my theories…” murmured Spike, worn out, as he settled into his seat. Twilight didn’t scold him; she had far too many things on her mind at the moment, too.

Twilight had to admit it: she knew very little about Cunabula. Its government, its history, its customs… the unknowns were overwhelming. There could easily be other hidden players there, guiding the decisions of that kingdom from the shadows and watching the events in Equestria with cold calculation. This hypothesis could explain the behavior of the Knights of Order, who might simply be waiting for the right moment to act.

If that were true, what happened in the Canterlot attack could happen again… or turn out even worse.

As she pondered, Twilight felt a bitter taste spreading in her mouth, as if something lay just in front of her that she couldn’t fully see.

Could she really make a responsible decision with so much unknown? Should she file the case away and leave the Knights of Order in Tartarus indefinitely? Would it make sense to prepare more escape plans in case of another attack?

The most irresponsible thing would be to just let them go, though…

“What if we just let them go?” Spike suggested jokingly, trying to ease the tension.

Twilight looked at him, clearly annoyed. Her frown said more than any words could, and it was enough to make her little dragon assistant step back.

Spike raised his claws, a bit nervous. “Well… I’m just saying, if all this is too much for us, maybe letting them go wouldn’t make a huge difference…”

“Did Discord suggest that to you?” Twilight asked with a serious look.

“Yes,” Spike admitted, sinking a little into his seat. He’d consulted the “Lord of Chaos” on the matter, given that Discord was partly responsible for the situation. Naturally, Discord’s answer had been typically discordant.

Twilight sighed once more. "I think, in a way, he's right. But it's not a decision I can make alone. I need the other kingdoms to consider my point of view. However, I don't have solid arguments to support that action… just a weak hope," she said, looking disheartened at the scroll.

Asking Discord for help in judging the case could backfire on her due to his past antics. Moreover, she doubted the Knights of Order would accept any "sincere" apologies from the "Lord of Chaos."

If she simply released them, the other kingdoms would surely see Equestria as an unreliable ally. And allowing those criminals, who had sworn to destroy them and had already attacked two kingdoms, to return to their homeland to continue their conspiracies would put Equestria at risk. While Twilight wanted to believe that the Knights of Order wouldn’t intervene again, she knew the likelihood was quite the opposite.

In the end, she still couldn't decide. She would have to wait and reflect more before reaching a conclusion.

With her magic, Twilight carefully stored the scroll in a special box along with other documents that would also be addressed next year. Seeing the accumulating amount compared to the previous year, she realized just how much her workload continued to grow. With a resigned sigh, she began organizing the rest of the documents.

When she finished, she felt a slight sense of relief. The clock indicated that there were still three hours until midnight.

"It's still early! How about we do a surprise inspection to check out this year’s decorations?" Twilight proposed to Spike as she stood up.

"I don’t know, Twilight. I’m feeling a bit tired today," Spike replied, feigning a yawn while trying to hide a hefty book behind him. "Why don’t you go alone this time?"

"Really? I thought bringing my 'number one assistant' on my 'royal back' would be a great reward for all his hard work," Twilight teased with a sly smile as she donned her royal attire. She already had an idea of the real source of Spike’s "tiredness."

Spike couldn’t resist the temptation and, flapping his tiny wings, jumped onto Twilight's back.

"Now that I think about it, I think I have an important message for the head chef. Do you mind if we swing by the kitchen first, Twilight?"

"Of course, but on the way, you’ll have to tell me some stories from the new Daring Do book," she replied as she levitated her crown and gently placed it atop her head.

"Perfect! Have you ever heard of the 'Hill of Eternity'?" Spike asked excitedly.

Both of them left the room smiling, leaving behind an untouched pudding and a cup of chocolate.
