In the majestic castle of Canterlot, Princess Twilight Sparkle, ruler of Equestria, entered with a regal step into one of the most exclusive rooms of her kingdom. This chamber, reserved only for her and a select group of ponies, was always ready to welcome her distinguished guests. As she entered, the princess was greeted by a delicate lavender scent that filled the air, mingling with the gentle evening breeze filtering through the beautiful glass windows adorning the tall walls. The warmth of the room, familiar and cozy, was maintained by a lit fireplace at the other end of the room.

Twilight walked leisurely, leaving behind her noble demeanor. With each step, she shed the adornments befitting her royal status. Her dress slid magically to the side, the clasps holding it in place softly fell onto the carpet, and the guards on her hooves rolled effortlessly until they bumped into some furniture or wall. She took special care only when placing her crown on a special bust located next to a large personal wardrobe.

Finally, without any accessory to distinguish her, just being herself, Twilight leapt towards the fluffy sofa in a corner of the room. Her descent was slow, defying gravity, made possible by the magic of her alicorn wings. Like a feather falling imperceptibly, Twilight found herself on her sofa.

The contact of her body with the furniture was perfectly silent. In a comfortable posture, she remained still for long minutes until she slowly stretched her body, pressing it down, seeking to feel the coolness of the inert furniture against her coat.

Twilight was exhausted.

The Festival of the Two Sisters was scheduled for the next day and she had been busy attending requests all day. Not just that day, but throughout the entire week, she had been overwhelmed with her royal duties. She had to handle the closing of Equestria's fiscal year, attend the award ceremony at the School of Friendship, participate in the graduation ceremony at the School of Magic, and many other matters that required her personal attention. In short, it had been an exhausting week.

She was an alicorn and, more importantly, a pony who knew how to organize. She had the time and planning experience needed to manage her daily responsibilities. However, there were days like this when she felt like she had aged centuries since her coronation. She knew it had only been three years. Even so, when she found herself alone and reflected on those years full of intense work and responsibilities, she couldn't help but feel a fleeting and childish sense of frustration.

Twilight raised her hoof against the sofa, a strong thud, and then hit it about four more times. After a moment, she got up and briefly examined it to check if she had damaged it. Confirming it was in perfect condition, she fell heavily onto it.

The fluffy sofa withstood her hooves like no other sofa in Equestria could have. She had acquired it on the advice of a good friend. At first, Twilight thought the price of that furniture was outrageous, but so far, it had been worth every bit she had paid for it.

That was the famous super fluffy and soft sofa recommended by Rarity, in her words, "worthy of a princess's 'royal' rest," and it had Rainbow Dash's special approval. Of course, the "special approval" involved Rainbow Dash using it first and then refusing to leave because of how comfortable it was. They even had to use magic to get her out of there.

Twilight smiled slightly as she reminisced about those times, her gaze wandering around the rest of the room. There were other familiar and cherished objects there, like Pinkie Pie's mini automatic candy machine. It always managed to provide the perfect pick-me-up flavor on the heaviest days.

There was also Fluttershy's library of relaxation books. Whenever she had trouble falling asleep, she would pick up a random book and dive into it. She never managed to finish any. Just one page was enough to send her off to sleep right there.

Lastly, there was Applejack's standing coat rack, which, curiously, was the most used item. Not for hanging dresses or royal clothes, but as a true "tree of ideas" or "idea rack," where she hung all her ideas and thoughts when she had to solve a complex problem.

All these objects were gifts from her friends, and they brought back good memories of shared moments. They would gather again tomorrow, but Twilight knew there was still work to be done. And despite her fatigue, she felt energized enough to finish it.

Someone knocked lightly on the door.

"Twilight, are you there yet? I've got the documents you asked for," Spike said from behind the door.

"Yes, Spike, just a moment." Twilight straightened up to look more regal, using her magic to tidy up her royal attire that was scattered around the room. Finally, she opened the door and a stack of scrolls entered with obedient Spike underneath them.

"Alright, here are all the scrolls. Gee, they're lighter than last year," the young purple dragon remarked sarcastically as he dropped them onto the center of the table.

"Yeah, this year we've sorted out a lot of issues. But look on the bright side, next year you'll have less weight to carry," Twilight replied as she began to gather up some scrolls that had fallen to the floor with her magic.

"I'm just worried it might be more than we can handle," Spike said with concern.

Twilight didn't respond and started organizing the scrolls by the color of their tags. Each one summarized some matter, issue, or event that had been marked as "observed" over the course of the year. Unfortunately, some of them were from the previous year.

The color of the scrolls varied in four shades representing their tagging rationale: green for opportunities, blue for strengths, orange for weaknesses, and red for threats.

This was a basic management exercise that needed to be done, as it would set the stage for the annual analysis she would conduct after the holidays.

Twilight used her magic to bring over the "idea rack" and pulled out a clean set of notecards. She was ready to start with the green topics and finish with the red ones.

"Spike, could you bring some pudding and chocolate, please?" Twilight requested.

// ----------

A couple of hours had passed, and Twilight had finally finished reviewing the penultimate scroll and closing her notes. Looking around, she noticed an empty plate with pudding crumbs on the table. Spike had been a great help at first, making suggestions and organizing notes on the "idea rack." But now, he was comfortably seated on a sofa, sipping hot chocolate while reading a voluminous book with a golden frame.

Twilight's curiosity was piqued as she glanced at the book Spike was reading. "What are you reading, Spike?"

"Mmm, it's A.K. Yearling's latest book, 'Daring Do and the Unfinished Journeys.'"

Twilight bit her lip. After a long wait, author A.K. Yearling had finally released a new Daring Do book earlier in the week. Spike noticed Twilight's dismayed expression and struck a proud pose. "It holds the record for being the best-selling book in its first week of release and it's also the longest she's ever written. It's an anthology of short stories across different genres, narrating her travels across Equestria and the world. It includes autobiographical stories and..."

"Please, don't go on, Spike," Twilight interrupted with a sigh. Although she had her own copy of the book, she hadn't had time to read it due to the week's workload. Rainbow Dash would probably rub it in her face all through tomorrow night. But if only she could sneak a quick peek at the summary...

"No!" Twilight internally halted her thoughts. She knew she had to finish today's work and there was only one scroll left to review. It was the only red-tagged scroll she had, and she remembered its contents vividly.

"Thanks, but let's save the spoilers for later, okay?" Twilight said as she opened the last scroll and began to review it. Spike watched her with concern as he finished his cup of hot chocolate. He, too, knew what that scroll was about.

This was a delicate matter that Twilight couldn't continue to ignore.

The "Knights of Order"...

It all began three years ago. Shortly after her coronation, Twilight began to shape the direction Equestria would take under her rule. It was then that she set out to improve relations with the neighboring kingdoms and beyond. By sending her friends and acquaintances as ambassadors with a message of friendship and respect, she hoped to learn more about the realities of these realms and, if possible, establish a common partnership with them.

These expeditions successfully reached their destinations and conveyed the message of friendship that Twilight wished to share. However, during these journeys, an unexpected discovery was made: the existence of other Trees of Harmony outside of Equestria. These trees, with meanings and magic different from those that once existed in the realm of ponies, posed an undeniable challenge to the expeditionary groups. With the improvised help of Equestria's ambassadors and the support of new friends in these realms, they managed to activate the magic of each of these new Trees of Harmony and discover their respective bearers.

That was when problems began to arise. Her friends soon discovered that they were not the first to find these Trees.

Many moons ago... a mysterious group of individuals had arrived from a distant land to these realms and had activated the magic of the Trees of Harmony with a message to protect these realms and bring prosperity to their inhabitants. They erected temples where each of the Trees stood, and within the temples, they placed mechanisms so that the inhabitants of each realm could access the magic of the Trees in the correct manner.

These individuals introduced themselves as the Knights of Harmony. Hailing from the magical realm of Cunabula, they were on a mission to awaken the magic of harmony in the world. A crusade led them to discover five of the six existing Trees of Harmony, and they were on the verge of awakening the sixth and final one in Equestria.

However, they did not succeed in their mission. Upon reaching the realm of ponies, they unfortunately found it under the rule of Discord, the Lord of Chaos. Discord, malicious at the time, unable to toy with the Knights of Harmony, decided to use his chaos magic to manipulate the inhabitants of the other realms they had previously visited and incite war against them.

The results of this conflict were devastating for Cunabula. Feeling betrayed by the nations they had once aided, the Knights of Harmony decided to close each of the temples they had built and erase any trace of harmony magic that might be within them. They concealed their own realm from the eyes of the world and wiped away any evidence of their existence.

Leaving behind the title of the Knights of Harmony, they rebranded themselves as the Knights of Order, with the vow to protect their realm and maintain order in the world. They were determined to eliminate anyone who dared to awaken the magic of the Trees again.

This crusade had remained dormant for over a millennium, until Twilight and her friends inadvertently revived it.

Without waiting for any explanation, the Knights of Order sprang into action, taking measures against the realms where the magic of the Trees of Harmony had been awakened. This escalation led to Danu, the leader of the current Knights, confronting Twilight and her friends in Canterlot itself. After an intense confrontation, Twilight and her friends found themselves cornered, at the mercy of the Knights, who intended to eliminate them and eradicate the remaining harmony magic within them.

Fortunately, with the help of other friends present at that moment and the timely arrival of new allies from the other realms, these plans were thwarted and the city was saved from catastrophe.

Thus, the Knights of Order were defeated and, with the approval of the leaders of the other realms, they were imprisoned and taken to Tartarus, Equestria's magical prison, where they would remain incarcerated to this day...

// ----------

Twilight sighed as she finished reading the contents of the red parchment. The report she read was as expected; the situation of the Knights of Order in Tartarus remained unchanged, and the findings about Cunabula were the same as the previous year.

In other words, there had been no progress.

Since the imprisonment of the Knights of Order, they had remained there without attempting to escape or cooperate to improve their penitentiary situation. Despite Twilight's best efforts to establish a connection with Danu, the leader of the Knights, he had remained steadfast in his refusal to speak to her during her visits. The same went for his companions. Therefore, apart from what they had learned in their initial encounter, nothing more had been discovered about them.

On the other hand, the island of Cunabula remained a mystery difficult to unravel. It was not found in any history books of Equestria or its allied realms. In a letter from Star Swirl the Bearded from Ornithia, the sage claimed to have discovered the flag of that nation, which was a green standard displaying a silver tree surrounded by six stars. His thorough research led him to conclude that the location of that kingdom likely lay somewhere in the southern seas. Unfortunately, that was all the information he could find. Nevertheless, Twilight decided to extend the investigation for another year, and then another, up to the present day.

Twilight sprawled on her couch, staring at the ceiling. That the situation remained the same might be considered a success for an uncommitted leader who only improvised solutions. She was not that kind of leader. As she thought more about the Knights of Order, her doubts grew...

"Tell me, Spike, why do you think no representative from Cunabula has attempted to communicate with us since the defeat of the Knights of Order?" Twilight asked without looking away from the ceiling.

"Uhmm..." Spike pondered in a thoughtful pose, though it was feigned as he anticipated Twilight asking about this topic. "It could be that they're very unpopular back home and we did their people a favor by imprisoning them."

"Really?" Twilight responded without turning to her dragon assistant. "I distinctly remember my first encounter with Danu and his companions. I didn't perceive them as reckless tyrants, but rather as conservative individuals, too committed to their cause..."

Twilight closed her eyes and began to reflect. Perhaps she was giving them too much credit, but much in Danu's discourse made her believe she was only seeing one facet of her opponent. The fact that the leader of the knights had initiated the initial conversation in their first encounter reinforced this idea.

"Well... maybe they don't know what to do back in their own country now that they're gone," Spike continued without much consideration in his words, "or maybe they're just really scared to leave their island... I mean, home."

"It's been three years, Spike. In Cunabula, they should have new leaders by now," Twilight replied, opening her eyes. "Even if not, their own supporters would have tried to seek them out or rescue them... Also, consider how quickly they managed to reach Equestria and how powerful they proved to be in battle. I don't think they're afraid to leave their home for fear of getting lost or harmed."

Taking into account the plot from Ornithia, the Knights of Order's actions in Canterlot, and her own discoveries about the Harmony temples, Twilight could be sure that Cunabula was not something to take lightly. It was a kingdom that had employed harmony magic for over a thousand years. Clearly, they were far ahead of their time back then. Nowadays, she couldn't imagine how much the difference could be. Being isolated from the world for so long should have delayed much of their progress, but it could have also driven their development in unexpected directions.

"I think those are all my options..." Spike replied wearily, immediately settling into his seat and saying no more. Twilight didn't reproach him; she had a lot on her mind at that moment.

She had to admit it. She knew too little about Cunabula. Its government, its history, its customs... it was too much. There could well be other unknown actors guiding decision-making in that realm and coldly observing events in Equestria from afar. This hypothesis would explain the behavior of the Knights of Order, who might simply be waiting for the right moment to act.

If that were the case, then what happened in the attack on Canterlot could repeat itself and result in something worse...

After her reflection, Twilight began to feel an unpleasant taste spreading in her mouth. It was as unsettling as having something right in front of her nose and not being able to see it.

Could she really make a responsible decision when there were so many unknowns? Should she just file away the case and leave the Knights of Order in Tartarus indefinitely? Would making more escape plans in case of attack even matter?

The most irresponsible thing she could do was simply let them go, though that would be...

"What if we just let them go?" Spike suggested jokingly, trying to ease the tension.

Twilight looked at him annoyed. "Well... I'm just saying that if this is too much for us... maybe letting them go wouldn't make much of a difference," Spike explained, a bit nervous under the princess's gaze.

"Did Discord suggest that to you?" Twilight asked with a serious look.

"Yeah," Spike replied, sinking into his seat. He had consulted the "Lord of Chaos" about the matter after all; he was partly responsible for the current situation. Of course, even though he was now considered a friend, the response he received was typically discordant.

Twilight sighed once more. "I think he might be right," she admitted. "But it's not a decision I can make alone. I need the other realms to consider my viewpoint. However, I don't have solid arguments to support that action... just a faint hope," she said as she looked disheartened at the parchment.

If she sought Discord's help to conduct a trial, the case could backfire due to his past mischief. Besides, she couldn't imagine the Knights of Order accepting the "sincere" apologies of the "Lord of Chaos."

If she simply released them, the other realms would surely consider Equestria an unreliable ally. Moreover, allowing those criminals, who had sworn to destroy them and had already attacked two kingdoms, to return to their country to continue their conspiracies would put Equestria in danger. Although she wanted to believe that the Knights of Order would not intervene again, she knew it was more likely that they would.

In the end, she couldn't make a decision yet. She would have to wait and reflect more on the matter before coming to a conclusion.

With her magic, Twilight carefully placed the parchment in a special box that already contained other documents to be attended to next year. Seeing the amount of parchment compared to the previous year, she realized how little her workload had decreased. With this in mind, she proceeded to organize the rest of the documents.

Once she finished her task, she felt a bit more upbeat. The clock struck the end of the hour, and she realized there were still three hours until midnight.

"It's still early! How about we do a surprise inspection to assess this year's decorations?" Twilight proposed to Spike, standing up.

"I don't know, Twilight. I'm feeling a bit tired today," Spike replied, feigning a yawn while trying to hide a thick book he had. "Why don't you go alone this time?"

"Really? I thought taking my number one assistant on my 'royal back' would be a fitting reward for his hard work," Twilight teased with a knowing look as she put on her royal attire. She already suspected the source of her dragon companion's tiredness.

Spike couldn't resist and, with a flap of his wings, jumped onto Twilight's back.

"I just remembered I have some special messages for the head chef. Mind if we go there first, Twilight?"

"No, if you tell me some stories from the new Daring Do book on the way," she replied as her royal crown levitated and settled gently on her head.

"Perfect! Have you ever read about the 'Hill of Eternity'?" Spike asked excitedly.

Both departed with smiles from the room, leaving behind untouched pudding and a cup of hot chocolate.
